Mirror Glyph Tool release 001
----------
Made by Michael Lang 08 August 2002


- Features:
* The tool generates a hash table used to locate mirrorglyph characters, using the original character as a key. 
The hash table is stored in C++ format in the form of a .inl file.
	

(Command line options can be found by calling the perl script with the -? option)


- Inputs:
* The script requires the use of an input file which should be named mglyphs.txt
	- Points to note:
		- The input data to place in the file can be found here:
			http://www.unicode.org/Public/3.0-Update1/BidiMirroring-1.txt
		- Take this file and rename it mglpyhs.txt, placing it in the same directory as the tool


- Outputs:
	- A HTML file
		- One of the command line options allows for a HTML file to be generated in 
		order to display output.
		- This file is called mglyphs.html by default
		
	- A .INL file
		- The tool generates a file called mglyphs.inl by default
		(see command line options for output format)
