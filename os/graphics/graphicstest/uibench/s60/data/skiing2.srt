     PREQ1939

00:00:08,000  -->  00:00:12,000
Video Subtitles and 
 Captioning Support 

4
00:00:15,000  -->  00:00:18,000
PREQ1939 is complete 
and available today.


5
00:00:18,000  -->  00:00:21,000
It is officially in Symbian OS 
Diran only, but the code is 

6
00:00:21,000  -->  00:00:24,000
present in 9.5 releases and is 
easy to enable and build. 

7
00:00:26,000  -->  00:00:29,000
This demo runs under a stock 
Symbian OS 9.5 DevKit release. 

8
00:00:29,000  -->  00:00:32,000
We have simply enabled NGA, 
enabled PREQ1939, 

9
00:00:32,000  -->  00:00:35,000
rebuilt MMF, and added a
simple demo application. 

10
00:00:35,000  -->  00:00:38,000
Detailed build info 
and this demo application is 

11
00:00:38,000  -->  00:00:41,000
available on request. 

12
00:00:44,000  -->  00:00:47,000
PREQ1939 requires that video 
playback uses graphics surfaces. 

13
00:00:47,000  -->  00:00:50,000
The actual subtitles however 
are rendered as UI graphics

14
00:00:50,000  -->  00:00:53,000
Using a Content Rendering 
Plugin (CRP) in Window Server. 

15
00:00:55,000  -->  00:00:58,000
The PREQ delivery includes all 
MMF and API changes, 

16
00:00:58,000  -->  00:01:01,000
a product-quality CRP for 
subtitle rendering, 

17
00:01:01,000  -->  00:01:04,000
and a reference SRT subtitle 
renderer in the AVI controller. 

18
00:01:06,000  -->  00:01:11,000
This demo uses a video-only 
AVI file with MPEG-4 video 

19
00:01:11,000  -->  00:01:14,000
and a hand-written SRT 
subtitle file. 

20
00:01:16,000  -->  00:01:19,000
Real-world implementations 
are expected to use 

21
00:01:19,000  -->  00:01:22,000
3GPP Timed Text instead. 

22
00:01:22,000  -->  00:01:25,000
In any case, all subtitles are 
rendered in the controller and 

23
00:01:25,000  -->  00:01:28,000
displayed directly using a CRP. 


24
00:01:28,000  -->  00:01:31,000
The application is not on the 
data path at all, and has only 

25
00:01:31,000  -->  00:01:34,000
basic control functionality. 


26
00:01:36,000  -->  00:01:59,000
Thank you
