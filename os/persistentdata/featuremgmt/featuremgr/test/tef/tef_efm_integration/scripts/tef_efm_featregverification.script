START_TESTCASE SYSLIB-EFM-CIT-4032
//! @SYMTestCaseID 		SYSLIB-EFM-CIT-4032
//! @SYMTestCaseDesc  		Feature data generator and ROM builder testing: check that rombuild still works with Feature Registry
//! @SYMTestPriority 		High 

//! @SYMTestActions 		This test must be performed on a ROM image built using the 'helpfiles\featregverification_test_rombuild.bat' batch file.
//!				The featregverification_test_rombuild.bat batch file builds a rom image using the standard Symbian feature 
//!				database xml file and a pre-created feature database xml in the feature registry format with a set of test features having a known state.
//!				After loading the rom image into a hardware board the featue information is requested by the test 
//!				code in this test case. The returned values are compared against the expected values.
//!				Feature information in the rom image is as follows:
//!				TestSupported (status - supported)
//!				TestUnsupported (status - unsupported)
//!				DSR with the range 0x10279806 - 0x10281805

//! @SYMTestExpectedResults 	Test passes if the feature information returned corresponds to the expected results, i.e. all 
//!				the feature requests in this test return correct information.
//! @SYMPREQ  			PREQ1645
//! @SYMREQ 			REQ8199
