; This security policy file is used by the DBMS security tests.
; There are 5 different DBMS tests:
; (1) - A test application with capabilities, which satisfy database's schema security policy.
; (2) - A test application with capabilities, which satisfy database's write security policy.
; (3) - A test application with capabilities, which satisfy read security policy of table "A".
; (4) - A test application with capabilities, which satisfy write security policy of table "B", although they cannot satisfy (UID: WRITE) policy.
; (5) - A test application without capabilities.
