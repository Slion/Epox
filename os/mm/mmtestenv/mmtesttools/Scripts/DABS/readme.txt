The .bat and .txt files in directories Batchfiles and CommandFiles has
been automatically generated by the Perl script
DABS_test_data.pl. That script uses a files called test_data.txt to
read which batch files copies over test data from the MMC card to the
C:-drive and delete the data from the C:-drive when test has
finished. 

test_data.txt was generated by executing "grep -i -l copy *.bat
>test_data.txt" in a Cygwin bash shell. The grep utility found on
\\londata21\tools works just as well. 

The .txt files contain the command autoexec.bat will execute on HW to
copy over the data. Eg MMFSbcUnitTests_del_data.txt contains the line:

call e:\MMFSbcUnitTests_del_data.bat

The .bat files contains the actual copy and delete commands.

These files are necessary because the DABS system uses one file to
build up the autoexec.bat file. A line in that file can look like:

testframework, logs\testresults\mm\TSU_MMF_SBCCODEC.htm, ,
\TSU_MMF_SBCCODEC.script, 600, UREL,
MMFSbcUnitTests_copy_test_data.txt,
MMFSbcUnitTests_del_test_data.txt 

where the two last arguments is the pretest and posttest command
files. Unfortunately the command file can only contain one line as
the DABS system only reads the first line in that file. Bonkers
but there you go.

The above test line will produce an autoexec.bat looking like this:

call e:\MMFSbcUnitTests_copy_test_data.bat
RUNTESTS testframeworkTSU_MMF_SBCCODEC.script.txt -t 10
call e:\MMFSbcUnitTests_del_test_data.bat
