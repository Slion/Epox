00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:25,200
O heaven, 
my friend Cinna

00:00:25,201 --> 00:01:00,200
I await here in vain. 
My impatience

4
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:02,000
Grows with his delaying. 
Alas, 
how wearisome

For the human heart, 
when doubts,

7
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:06,025
Waver betwixt hope and fear...

8
00:01:06,026 --> 01:01:20,000
But, am I not misled?

01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:30,010
He comes! The gods be praised!
