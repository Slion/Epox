This component just contains the python script to convert the Mozilla root certificate store into the file format that can be used by the Symbian OS file-based certificates store.

The latest Mozilla certificate store can be obtained from http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt?raw=1

After fetching the above certificate store file (certdata.txt) run the script (certconvert.py --help) for more information.
