First mainline release of certificate management code
This release consists of 6 DLLs:

asn1.dll: 
	-basic ASN.1/DER decoding functionality
	-depends on euser and bigint
x500.dll:
	-processing of X.500 Distinguished Names
	-depends on euser, estor and asn1
crypto.dll:
	-handling of generic signature verification functionality
	-depends on euser, estor, cryptalg and hash
certstore.dll
	-handling of certificate storage
	-depends on euser, estor, efsrv and crypto
x509.dll
	-processing of X.509 certificates
	-depends on euser, bafl, estor, asn1, certstore bigint, x500, cryptalg and crypto
	-extraction of DH keys is currently *not* supported: this will happen in the next
	release
pkixCert.dll
	-processing of X.509 certificates according to the PKIX profile (RFC 2459)
	-depends on euser, x500, x509, certstore and crypto

3 test executables are also included with the release:

tx509.exe:
	-tests X.509 certificate processing, including OOM handling
	-requires the existence of a directory 'c:\system\testdata'
	-the program reads all the files in the directory and attempts 
	to process them as X.509 certificates
	-for each file it attempts to process, it writes success or failure 
	to the console. The names of failed files are written to 'c:\errfile.txt',
	and details of each successfully parsed certificate to 'c:\outfile.txt'
	-a .zip file, 'testdata.zip' is included in '\certman\tx509': this 
	contains sample X.509 certificates which may be extracted to 
	'c:\system\testdata' for processing.
tcertstore.exe:
	-tests basic certificate store functionality
	-requires the existence of an certificate store file, 'certx509.dat', in 
	'c:\system\data', and the existence of certain specific certificate files in 
	'c:\system\testdata': these files, along with a suitable certificate store, 
	are included in the .zip file 'testdata.zip' which is found in '\certman\tcertstore'
tpkixcert.exe
	-test basic chain building functionality, and a little validation functionality
	-requires the existence of certain specific certificate files in 
	'c:\system\testdata': these files are included in the .zip file 'testdata.zip' 
	which is found in '\certman\tpkixcert'. It also reqiuires the existence of a file called 
	'correctchain.txt' in 'c:\': this file is also included in the .zip.

N.B. certstore.dll also needs a certificate store file, 'certx509.dat', in 'c:\system\data'. 
While it is best if the tcertstore test program starts with an empty store, it is more useful to 
dependent code if the store is already populated. So, an alternative 'certx509.dat' is included in 
'\certman\certstore' for use by certstore.dll when code other than the dedicated test code is using it.
This file currently contains:

		Name = "T_SSLWeb.exe", UID = 1
