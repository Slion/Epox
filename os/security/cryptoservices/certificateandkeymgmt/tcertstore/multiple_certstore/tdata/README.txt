The files 'cacerts5.dat' and 'certclients5.dat' contains duplicate labels and duplicate UIDS respectively.
These are generated by temporarily modifying the production code fstokenserver.exe to allow addition of certificates having 
duplicate labels to be appended in the certstore. Likewise updating was done to allow addition of applications having 
same UIDS to be appended in certappstore. These were generated for testing CR1393, which won't allow addition of duplicates 
from either within a single or across multiple certstores and multiple certappstores. 

The file 'swicertstore5.dat' contains certificates having duplicate labels. The file was generated by temporarily modifying
swicertstoretool to allow adition of certificates having duplicate labels. These were generated for testing CR1393 
which won't allow addition of duplicate labels from either within a single or across multiple swicertstores.
