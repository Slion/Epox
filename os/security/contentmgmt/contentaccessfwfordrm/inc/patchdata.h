/**
This 8-bit variable is used in agent resolution. It is used to override CAF's 
default resolution behaviour of only loading Content Access Agents (CAAs)
from the ROM drive. Compile time value is 0 - default resolution behaviour. 
When non-zero CAF will load all CAA visible to the ECOM service regardless of 
the drive. In the emulator platform the default resolution behaviour is the 
same as when this variable is non-zero, therefore loading all CAAs.

This variable is changed at ROM build time using the patchdata obey keyword.
See Symbian OS Developer Library documentation on how to patch DLL data exports.
