* Description: 
* dummyecchwplugin.dll is a cryptospi plug-in which provides a dummy 
* implementation of Ecc. This is used for reference and testing 
* purposes only. This does not actually implement the ecc algorithm. 
* This plug-in performs cryptographic operations without having access 
* to the actual key. It accomplishes this in the following way:-
* a) extracts the key handle
* b) uses this handle to invoke cryptospihai.dll. cryptospihai.dll 
* performs the operations and returns the output back.
* Licensees can use this plug-in as a reference for implementing a 
* similar plug-in.
