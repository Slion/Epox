* Description: 
* cryptospihai.dll provides a reference implementation for cryptospi 
* hardware abstraction interface (HAI). This is used by a cryptospi  
* plugin, in the case where actual keys are stored in hardware. This 
* plugin does the following:-
* a) extracts the key from Crypto Token HAI
* b) performs the operations (signing and decryption)
* c) returns the results to the spi plugin. 
* Licensees can use this plug-in as a reference for implementing a 
* similar plug-in.
