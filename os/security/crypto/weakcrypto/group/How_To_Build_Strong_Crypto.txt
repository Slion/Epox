Previously it was not possible for teams other than Security to build the crypto
library as the source code was licensed from RSA and access to it was
restricted.  Now that the source for cryptography.dll is accessible in the
master codeline all teams can build this library according to their needs.

To build strong crypto, you must build the file crypto/strong/bld.inf in
addition to crypto/group/bld.inf.  This will generate an addition dll,
strong_cryptography.dll.

This can be included in ROMs by specifying the flag USE_STRONG_CRYPTOGRAPHY.  On
the emulator, the strong version is automatically picked up if it has been built.
