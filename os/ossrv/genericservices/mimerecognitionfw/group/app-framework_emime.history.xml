  <purpose>
    Support for MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) types. MIME types are generally calculated from filename extensions and the opening characters of data files (or in the case of native Symbian OS files, the UID). Applications may specify supported MIME types in their AIF files. Extensible by adding MIME type recognizer plug-ins.
