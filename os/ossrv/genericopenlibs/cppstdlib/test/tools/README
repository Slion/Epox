PreTest
==============================
Build libstdcpp for Winscw, ARMV5

Build PlumHall for winscw ARMV5





WINSCW Tests
==========================
1. Copy ph_exe_list.bat to EPOCROOT\epoc32\release\winscw\udeb\z 
2. If there is a file ph.log in EPOCROOT\epoc32\winscw\c, delete it
3. Run epoc
4. Open eshell
5. Goto Z:  (type z: in eshell)
6. Run all tests (type ph_exe_list.bat)
   This runs all the EXEs and generates a report file ph.log in EPOCROOT\epoc32\winscw\c.

7. To generate a summary, copy the script ph_log_analysis.pl to EPOCROOT\epoc32\winscw\c 
and run it (From a windows command prompt, type "perl ph_log_analysis.pl")
A summary file (PH_report.txt) is generated in the same directory.


PS: The no of test cases are around 2500-2600.  
If the summary is showing more, delete the ph.log file as mentioned above and run the tests again.

ARM Tests
==========================================
1. Build libstdcpp and plumhall for ARMV5
2. Create a new directory for building ROM.  (eg: /epoc32/ph_rom)
3. copy ph_exe_list.bat to this directory    (eg: /epoc32/ph_rom)
4. Open a command prompt, change to this new directory.

5. Build ROM with this command
   buildrom h4hrp textshell -D_FULL_DEBUG openenv.iby plumhalltests.iby

6. You'll get a .IMG file.  Rename it to sys$rom.bin.  Copy it into the H4 board's memory card.
7. Boot H4. 
8. Open EShell.
9. Run ph_exe_list.bat

The test log is created in E:  (memory card)
Once the tests are done, copy the test log from the memory card to PC.
