// Read Me file for the engineering component folder
// Last updated: 15 Jan 2007
 
The engineering folder exists to hold engineering documentation and
artifacts related to the component's development that are NOT suitable for 
inclusion into the documentation folder. 

Files in the documentation folder are automatically picked up into the Symbian 
Developer Library material and required a higher level of quality to be attained 
than those that would be found here. However, the files held here need to be 
complete and accurate as they are shipped with the component source in CustKits.

Typical files found in this folder include:

o  Doxygen and compiled HTML files.
o  Feature design & test documentation from projects
o  Component test documentation
o  Object models from Rational rose or Enterprise Architect
o  Performance reports/data
o  Technical reports
o  Component UID usage logs
