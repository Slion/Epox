// specify the platforms your component needs to be built for here
// defaults to WINS MARM so you can ignore this if you just build these
DEFAULT

PRJ_TESTEXPORTS
// NOTE: If using ARS requirements all export operations should be done under this.
// 'abld test export'

PRJ_EXPORTS
// Specify the source file followed by its destination here
// copy will be used to copy the source file to its destination
// If there's no destination then the source file will be copied
// to the same name in /epoc32/include
// Example: 

crypto_test.cfg /epoc32/winscw/c/TestFramework/crypto_test.cfg
TestFramework.ini /epoc32/winscw/c/TestFramework/crypto_test/TestFramework.ini
evptests.txt /epoc32/winscw/c/TestFramework/evptests.txt

// NOTE: If using ARS requirements .mmp file operation should be done under this.
// 'abld test build'

PRJ_MMPFILES
// Specify the .mmp files required for building the important component
// releasables.
//
// Specify "tidy" if the component you need to build doesn't need to be

// ignored.
// Example:
/*
/agnmodel/group/agnmodel.mmp
#if defined(MARM)
/agnmodel/group/agsvexe.mmp
#endif
