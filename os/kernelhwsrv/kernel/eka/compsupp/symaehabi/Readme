Exceptions library release 2.01.

This source code is intended to be compliant with release 2.0 of the
EHABI.

Changes against the 2.0 (November 2004) release of these sources are as
follows:

1) Changed licence agreement.

2) Minor bug fix to restoring VFP registers on some architectures.

The 2.0 (November 2004) source releases contained the following changes
against the February 2004 release:

1) Minor changes due to progress on the ARM toolchain itself.

2) A small amount of tidying up.

3) Changes to reflect the resolutions agreed in the conference calls,
namely fixes for type matching, for unwinding frames in which VFP
registers were saved by FSTMD (instead of FSTMX), and for consequences
arising from the use of different relocations.

4) The personality routine now defends itself a little against broken
unwind instructions, by verifying that the notional return address is
updated by the unwinding instructions. Also the unwinding of WMMX
registers was performed incorrectly.

5) In the unwinder, __ARM_Unwind_VRS_corerestore is now safe against
data aborts occurring while restoring the core registers from the stack.
