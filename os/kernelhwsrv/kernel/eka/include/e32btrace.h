/**
Class for handling fast tracing.

A trace record consists of three parts: a header, header extensions,
and the trace data itself.

The header consists of four bytes containing:

-#	Size of the record in bytes. (Maximum value is KMaxBTraceRecordSize.)
-#	Flags. See enum TFlags.
-#	Category. Category value from enum BTrace::TCategory.
-#	Sub-category. The meaning of this is dependent on the value of Category.

When trace records are stored in memory they are stored word (32 bit) aligned.
Therefore the size must be rounded up to a multiple of four when calculating
the address of the next record. E.g.
@code
	TUint8* record; // pointer to trace record
	TInt size = record[BTrace::ESizeIndex];
	record += (size+3)&~3; // move record pointer on to next record.
@endcode
The NextRecord() method is provided to do this operation.

Following the header are optionally a number of 32 bit 'header extension' values.
These are present in the order shown below but only exist if the appropriate flag bit
is set in the Header.

-#	Header2.		Contains flag values from enum Flags2.
					This value is only present if the EHeader2Present flag is set.
-#	Timestamp.		A timestamp value indicating when the trace was generated.
					The format and resolution of this value are platform-dependent, but
					typically will contain the same values as would be returned by
					User::FastCounter() or NKern::FastCounter().
					This value is only present if the ETimestampPresent flag is set.
-#	Timestamp2.		Additional timestamp information. E.g. the most significant
					half of a 64bit timestamp value. Note, it is valid for a Timestamp2 value
					to be present even if the previous Timestamp is absent.
					This value is only present if the ETimestamp2Present flag is set.
-#	Context ID.		This value indicates the context in which the trace was generated.
					The meaning of the id is dependent on the contents of the two
					least significant bits:
					-	00	indicates the value is the address of the NThread object for
							the currently executing thread.
					-	01	indicates Fast Interrupt (FIQ) context.
							Other bits of the value are currently reserved for future use.
					-	10	indicates Interrupt (IRQ) context. Other bits of the value
							are currently reserved for future use.
					-	11	indicates Immediate Delayed Function Call (IDFC) context.
							Other bits of the value are currently reserved for future use.
					.
					This value is only present if the EContextIdPresent flag is set.
-#	Program Counter. This is the memory address of the instruction after the location
					the trace was output.
					This value is only present if the EPcPresent flag is set.
-#	Extra.			An extra value used for different purposes depending on the trace type.
					This value is only present if the EExtraPresent flag is set.

Following the header extensions are 0 or more bytes of trace data specified when the trace
was output.

To output a trace, the following macros can be used:
- BTrace0
- BTrace4
- BTrace8
- BTrace12
- BTraceN
- BTraceBig
- BTracePc0
- BTracePc4
- BTracePc8
- BTracePc12
- BTracePcN
- BTracePcBig
- BTraceContext0
- BTraceContext4
- BTraceContext8
- BTraceContext12
- BTraceContextN
- BTraceContextBig
- BTraceContextPc0
- BTraceContextPc4
- BTraceContextPc8
- BTraceContextPc12
- BTraceContextPcN
- BTraceContextPcBig

Whenever a trace is output, the trace handler is called with the arguments specified.
See typedef THandler and SetHandler().

Each tracing category has a filter bit, which if set to zero means that traces in that category
are discarded, see SetFilter(). This filtering is performed before the trace handler is
called. This filter may also be initialised from boot time by using the 'btrace' keyword in
an OBY file used to build a ROM image.

Traces may also be additionally sent through a second level of filtering. This examines the
first 32 bits of data in the trace and if this value isn't present in the list maintained
in the secondary filter, the trace is discarded. The contents of the secondary filter are
set using the SetFilter2 methods.

Values used for secondary filtering must be Symbian Unique Identifiers (UIDs) allocated
using the normal UID allocation process. Note, the following non-valid UID value ranges
are reserved.
- 0x00000000..0x007fffff	Reserved for platform specific use.
- 0x00800000..0x00ffffff	Reserved for use by Symbian.

To generate traces which are to be processed by the secondary filter, the following
macros can be used:

- BTraceFiltered4
- BTraceFiltered8
- BTraceFiltered12
- BTraceFilteredN
- BTraceFilteredBig
- BTraceFilteredPc4
- BTraceFilteredPc8
- BTraceFilteredPc12
- BTraceFilteredPcN
- BTraceFilteredPcBig
- BTraceFilteredContext4
- BTraceFilteredContext8
- BTraceFilteredContext12
- BTraceFilteredContextN
- BTraceFilteredContextBig
- BTraceFilteredContextPc4
- BTraceFilteredContextPc8
- BTraceFilteredContextPc12
- BTraceFilteredContextPcN
- BTraceFilteredContextPcBig

Traces generated using the above methods will be filtered twice; once using the primary
filter which checks the trace's category, and once using the secondary filter which checks
the 32 bit UID value at the start of the trace data. Therefore the trace must pass both filter
checks for it to be sent to the trace handler for output.

	Values for multipart trace indicator. These values are stored in Flags2 an
	are obtained by ANDing with the value EMultipartFlagMask.

	If a 'Big' trace is generated which doesn't fit into a single trace record
	then its data is split into several separate trace records; a multipart trace.

	In multipart traces the 'extra' trace value is present in the header extension.
	(EExtraPresent is set.) This extra value contains a unique trace identifier
	which is the same is all parts of the trace.

	The structure of the data part of each trace record in a multipart trace is described
	below. In this description, the following labels are used.
	-	A is the initial 4 bytes of data; the a1 argument of BTraceBig.
	-	D is the array of bytes of additional data; the aData argument of BTraceBig.
	-	N is the size of D; the aDataSize argument of BTraceBig
	-	X is the maximum number of additional bytes which will fit into a trace record.
		This is usually KMaxBTraceDataArray but this should not be assumed, instead
		the size and other information present in each trace record should be examined.

	For the first part of a multipart trace, the data in a trace record has the following
	structure:

	-	4 bytes containing N.
	-	4 bytes containing A.
	-	X bytes containing D[0..X-1]

	If the parts are numbered 0 through to 'j', then a middle part of a multipart trace
	is numbered 'i' where 0<i<j. The data in these parts has the structure:

	-	4 bytes containing N.
	-	4 bytes containing X*i. I.e. the offset within D for the data in this trace record.
	-	X bytes containing D[X*i..X*i+X-1]

	For the last part of a multipart trace, the data has the structure:

	-	4 bytes containing N.
	-	4 bytes containing X*j. I.e. the offset within D for the data in this trace record.
	-	N modulo X bytes containing D[X*j..N-1]. I.e. the final bytes of the trace data.

	The trace handler may add timestamp values to the trace it outputs, in which case

	IMPORTANT NOTES.
	-	The handler must not make use of any kernel APIs, apart from TDfc::RawAdd(). (This is
		because kernel APIs may contain tracing and this would result in deadlock of the system.)
	-	The trace handler must not access or modify arguments which are not indicated as
		being present by their flag in aHeader or aHeader2.
		In particular, on ARM CPUs, the values a2, a3, aExtra and aPc are stored on the stack
		and the caller of this function may not have created these arguments before calling the
		trace handler.
	-	The handler may be called in any context and in a re-entrant manner. Implementations must
		be designed to cope with this.
	-	The interrupt disable status must not be reduced by the trace handler during its operation.
		E.g. if IRQs are disabled on entry, the handler must not cause them to become enabled
		at any point.
