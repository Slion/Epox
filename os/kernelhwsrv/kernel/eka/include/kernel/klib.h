and provides a virtual destructor. It also offers the additional ability to
trigger asynchronous deletion of the object, which is important in
time-critical code.

An 8-bit kernel-side heap descriptor whose data can be modified.

This is a descriptor class, which provides a fixed length buffer for

represents is part of the descriptor object itself.

Heap descriptors have the important property that they can be made larger or
smaller, changing the size of the data area. This is achieved by explicitly
reallocating the descriptor. Note that reallocation is not done automatically.
