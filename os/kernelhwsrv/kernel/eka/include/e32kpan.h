Typically, they are caused by passing bad or contradictory parameters
to functions. Threads that cause exceptions also raise a KERN-EXEC type panic.

	This panic can be raised as a result of a call to one of a large
	number of functions. In general, the panic indicates an attempt to perform an
	operation on a thread or process by code running in another process - violating
	the security principle of process isolation. 
		
	There are exceptions to this general rule, for example, where the
	panic is raised because the calling process has insufficient capability. The
	precise reason is stated with the function(s). 
	
	-# The panic is raised on a call to the following function if the
	   process owning the thread performing the call is not the creator of the target
	   process or, if a handle is specified, the handle is not local.
	   - RProcess::SetParameter()
	   .
	-# The panic is raised on a call to the following functions if the
	   process owning the thread performing the call is not the same as the target
	   process.\n
	   - RProcess::Kill()
	   - RProcess::Terminate()
	   - RProcess::Panic()
	   - RProcess::SetJustInTime()

	   - RThread::Kill()

	   - RThread::Resume()
	   - RThread::SetPriority()		 
	   - RThread::RequestComplete()
	   - RThread::RequestSignal()

	   NOTE: the creator of a new process can kill or panic the new
	   process, change the new process priority and set the new process startup
	   parameters until the process is resumed (which the creator can also do). After
	   the new process has been resumed, then it becomes totally independent of its
	   creator, and any attempt to panic it, kill it etc will raise the KERN-EXEC 46
	   panic.
	-# The panic is raised on call to the following (Symbian partner
	   only) functions if the calling process does not have the PowerMgmt
