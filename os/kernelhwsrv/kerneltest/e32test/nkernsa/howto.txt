How to run the standalone nanokernel tests
==========================================

The standalone nanokernel tests run in a very restricted environment, compiled
directly into a minimal version of the nanokernel. Only the single memory model
is supported, and armv5 roms cannot be built due to an issue with RVCT's
runtime libraries.

No display driver is included in this environment, the only output is via
bootstrap debug support. For this to work you must either boot the rom via
serial download, so that the bootloader initialises the serial port, or
uncomment "GBLL	CFG_InitDebugPort" in ne1_tb\single\config.inc before building
the bootstrap.

To build this for NaviEngine SMP:

cd \bsp\hwip_nec_naviengine\ne1_tb\single
abld build arm4smp nkern_sa
abld test build arm4smp nktest_lib
abld test build arm4smp nktest
cd \e32\rombuild
rom -v sne1_tb -i arm4smp -x arm4smp -t nktest

Either udeb or urel may be used depending if you want to use the benchmarks.

The resulting rom will run all the nanokernel standalone tests, which takes
quite a while: you may wish to comment some of them out in main.cpp here.
