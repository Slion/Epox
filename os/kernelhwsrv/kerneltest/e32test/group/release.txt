		a)  We don't check any longer at the beginning of the test suite whether we're
		running on a 'UsbPlatform': If we're not, then the subsequent attempt to load the
		USB LDD will fail anyway.
		b)  We now execute the endpoint stall tests only if we're running on a known
		supported platform, otherwise we just skip those tests. 
2)	AndrewHi

		worthless (see defect notes in TT)

2)	MichaelP
	1)	Fixed defect DEF042556 - "Wrong IPR categorisation on usbrflct binaries":
		Changed IPR category of USB test prgram USBRFLCT (in directory
		/e32test/win32/usbrflct_distribution) from B to E. Permission to do so was

Version 2.00.519
===========================
(Made by JonathanM, 26/02/2004)

1.	JonathanM
	1.	Modified T_CAPSUP to test new Platform Security classes: TCapabilitySet and TSecurityInfo
	2.	Added T_PLATSECCONFIG which tests use of the PlatSecDisabledCaps keywork in OBY files
		and Emulator INI files.

================
(Made by AndrewHi, 23/01/2004)

1.	CiprianM
	1.	Fixed DEF040971  Benchmark suite test code optimised out by RVCT in ARM5 builds 

2.	AndrewHi
	1.	Modified t_lfsdrv2 to conditionally apply Read-While_Write tests for FLASH devices.
		The condition is dependent on the value of the device identifier read from the chip. 
		Currently, these tests are only applied for TYAX flash devices.

Version 2.00.517
================
(Made by StefanW, 09/01/2004)

1.	CarlosF
 	1.	IBUG-5QNJZC "Implement CR IBUG-5N2DZE on Cedar": Modified T_SERIAL to test the new
 		turnaround feature.

Version 2.00.516
================
(Made by StefanW, 19/12/2003)

1.	MichaelP
	1.	Updated USBRFLCT to use USBIO v2.0: Upped USBRFLCT version to 1.2.0 and recompiled
		it against USBIOLIB 2.0. Updated USBRFLCT.SYS to version 2.0. Added separate driver
		version for Win98 (USBRFL98.SYS, renamed from USBIO98.SYS) and added entries to the
		usbrflct.inf file so it gets installed on Win98SE.
	2.	Deleted USB host side GUI test program USBTEST. This program has been discontinued.
	3.	Added complimentary version of USBRFLCT:
		USBRFLCTD.EXE is a version of USBRFLCT.EXE with lots of verbose output
		activated; otherwise it's exactly the same program.
		The output, most importantly the error messages, can be used to track down
		problems when trying to get USBRFLCT and T_USB to work together, either for the
		first time (after a Base/PSL port), or after installation changes on the PC.

Version 2.00.515
================
(Made by JonathanM, 05/12/2003)

1.	ChrisM
	1.	Fixed Defect DEF040185 - Some e32tests make assumptions about the time and date formatting 
		Set the locale before the test to the locale info used in the base test roms.  Reset it back
		to the current locale at the end.

2.	MichaelP
	1.	Added new USB test program T_USBAPI: This program tests device side USB API
		functionality that is not dependent upon a physical USB connection; it requires
		no manual intervention and can thus be run as part of an automated test suite.
		These tests used to be part of T_USB but they have been removed from there.

3.	JonathanM
	1.	Modified T_TIMER on Lubbock so it doesn't attempt to power off.
		(Because the Base Port doesn't support this.)

Version 2.00.514
================

Version 2.00.500
================
(Made by AndrewT, 23/05/2002)

Version 1.01.063
================
(Made by Dennis, 04/04/2002)

1)	Nicolas
	1)	Submitted Jon's changes to T_KHEAP.  This test now
		checks that there is no memory leak if an OOM occurs

Version 1.01.062
================
(Made by CarlosF,  13/02/2002)

1)	Nicolas

		which was commented out.  This helped find an
		untrapped leave in the process creation code which has
		been fixed.
	2)	In T_KHEAP, enabled again the chunk-related code which
		was commented out.  A comment said that the code
		(setting the next kernel heap allocation to fail and
		check that the chunk size can be adjusted) was
		disabled because it could not possibly work.  Actually
		it does because the memory used when adjusting a chunk
		is taken straight from the physical memory pool, not
		from the kernel heap.
	3)	Silenced warnings in T_KHEAP.

Version 1.01.061
================
(Made by ChrisM,  06/03/2002)

================
(Made by Dennis,  26/10/2001)

1)	MarkCa
	1)	Moved some definitions from P32MMC.H into T_PWSTR.CPP because it can
		only be included into ASSP-specific builds.  See \e32\release.txt.

		- Renabled the power handling tests and modified them to conform to the
		serial driver 'idle off' power scheme.
	2) Fixed PAS-4WRMQS "Requeing a read() after PowerOn Panics the Driver/Kernel"
		- Added tests to T_PCCD1 for the new KPccdConfigOverrideNormalPwrEvents option
		now supported by the PC Card Controller function:
		DPcCardController::RequestConfig().

	3) Fixed MAY-4ZGH8S: "t_serial shoots itself in the foot, and can never pass".

Version 1.01.057
================
(Made by ChrisM,  05/10/2001)
1)	ChrisM

2)	Pete
	1) 	Removed \e32test\group\mnt.bat which was redundant.
	2)	Fixed PSCE-4YTR5G "Update SEROUT example driver":-
		Improved the power handling in the example driver SEROUT.LDD - making
		it more representative of other device drivers.
		Modified the driver so that it supports 19200bps+9600bps rather than
		9600bps+300bps (together with corresponding changes to the test program
		T_SEROUT).
		Removed simulation of emergency power down from the driver and test.
		Modified test program so that during the XON/XOFF test it runs until a
		key is pressed rather than running for a fixed period of time. 
		Modified test program so it unloads the Brutus PDD rather than the Cogent
		PDD at the end. 
	3) 	Added new tests for functions TBusLocalDrive::SetMountInfo() and 
		TBusLocalDrive::ForceRemount() to T_MEDDRV.EXE. Corresponding changes to
		MEDT1.PDD and MEDT2.PDD which now require the correct

		has this functionality.

Version 0.01.053
================
(Made by Pete, 10/05/2001)

1)	Pete
	1)	Minor change to T_PCCD3 to allow it to be re-run. Prior to
		this, it passes the first time run but then subsequently fails

2)	Nicolas

1)	Morgan
	1)	Added test code for RMessagePtr::IsNull to T_MESSGE


Version 0.01.036
================
(Made by RobertJ, 13/12/2000)

1)	Alastair
	1)	Added new test, t_thread2, because t_thread was becoming quite big.

		thread suspends itself.

2) Morgan
	1)	Disabled serial logging over time critical parts of T_CPER for
		platforms with slow serial devices

3) Dennis
	1)	Fixed defect EDNRFID-4PXFJ8 (Not enough output in T_Y2K).

================
Made by Nicolas, 19/10/2000

1) Pete 
	1)	Disabled T_PCCD1, T_PCCD2 and T_PCCD3 in WINS builds
		since WINS is now built with an MMC Peripheral bus controller rather
		than an PC Card MMC Controller. (These tests will be

================
Made by Alastair, 2/8/2000

1)	Alastair
	1)	Completed fix to EDNCMOS-4M8F52 "t_thread undertaker test failure".

3) Dennis
	1) Modified T_CPER to print the times at which the locked timers expire.
	2) Modified T_INACT and T_TIMER to test that inactivity timers are
		unaffected by system time changes.

Version 0.01.030
================
Made by Morgan, 5/7/00

1) RobertJ
	1) Modified t_fir2 to be more rigorous. Now writes the sent length into
	the first 2 bytes of the buffer so that the receiver can see if the
	correct length was received. Also modified text menus, added a nominal
	1ms delay and changed 2051 bytes option to 2042 so that 2051 is covered
	at the upper limit of the test. Text report now shows the number of frames,
	the number of errors and the error %ge

	
Version 0.01.029
================
Made by Bob 29-06-2000

1) Pete

		 "Test T_Thread failing intermittently under WINS UDEB"


Version 0.01.025
================
(Made by Morgan, 14.04.2000)

1)	Pete
	1) 	Removed calls of UserPcCardCntrl::PwrDown();
	2) 	Modified serial tests so that it is possible to
		overide the default serial port designated to be used
		by that test by supplying a serial port number on the
		command line:-
			- T_SERIAL p1 p2
			- T_MODEM1 p1
			- T_COMMSK p1
			- T_DCEUTL p1

2)	Nicolas
	1)	Removed T_DBG and T_BREAK.  application debugging tests are
		now in F32TEST because F32 is needed to copy support
		files to the RAM-drive.
		
3)	MarkCa
	1)	\E32TEST\WINDOW\T_MMCPW.CPP: no longer tests that
		KMaxMediaPassword % 4 == 0.
		
4)	Morgan
	1)	Copied k32snd.* and d32snd.* from \e32\include into e32test
		so the sound test programs build.  These files are no longer
		exported from E32

5)	Alastair
	1)	Updated t_euniw test to cope with CreateMutex() and OpenMutex().

		Cogent.
	3)	Exteneded T_DTENOT to cover signal change notification for
		each of the CTS/DSR/DCD signals becoming MARK or SPACE.
		Test now passes on WINS,MAWD,MISA,MEIG,MCGA.

2)	Robert
	1)	Added Slow IR test T_SLOWIR


Version 0.01.021
================
(Made by Dennis, 14-02-2000)

		exist).

2)	Mark
	1)	Added T_EUNIW to test unicode wrapper functions in EUNIW.DLL.

3)	MarkCa
	1)	Added T_SEROUT test program to test SEROMAWD.PDD, SEROWINS.PDD and
		SEROUT.LDD in EXAMPLE dir.

4)	Pete
	1) 	Further changes to T_MODEM2 to work with MAWD CF card modem driver.


Version 0.01.020
================
(Made by Simon, 03-02-2000)

1)	Pete
	1) 	Modified T_MODEM2 to work with MAWD CF card modem driver.
	2)	Modified T_DCE to take into account Cogent Serial PDD re-org.

2)	Simon
	1)	Replaced '/e32/inc' paths with '/epoc32/include /epoc32/include/kernel' in
		a number of mmp files.

Version 0.01.019
================
(Made by Dennis, 19/01/00)

1)	Alastair
	1)	Removed ARM3 and MARM targets from BLD.INF.
	2)	Minor fix to T_EXC so that it works under WINC.
	2)	Minor change to T_WBC to format test output correctly.

2)	Pete
	1)	Changes due to the removal in E32 of the classes
		TLocalDrive, RLogicalChannel, RDevComm.

1)	Dennis
	1)	Removed tests for functions which no longer exist.
	2)	Changed T_BUF, T_R32 and T_FLOAT to use TRealX instead of TReal96.
	3)	Added chkstk.obj to T_FLOAT so it works on WINS.
	4)	Removed T_R96 since TReal96 no longer exists.
	5)	Temporarily removed T_R64 since it made extensive use of TReal96 and
		simply changing over to TRealX doesn't work since the extra precision
		of TRealX makes the tests fail. What is really needed is a set of test
		vectors for TReal64.
	6)	Increased stack size for T_BUF to 12K.


Version 0.01.018
================
(Made by Peter, 21st December 1999)

1) Pete
	1)	Added T_DTENOT to test DTE serial driver change notifiers.
	2)	Added T_DCE and T_DCEUTL to test DCE serial driver.

Version 0.01.017
================
(Made by Morgan, 3/12/99)

1)	Dennis
	1)	Fixed T_MESSGE problem caused by different panic code following IPC
		changes.
	2)	Modified tests so they can run from any drive, not just Z:. This
		basically involved removing explicit references to Z: - we use
		RProcess().FileName() to determine the path instead.
	3)	Added test program T_WBC to test that write back cache is flushed
		when memory is unmapped.
	4)	Changed T_SVR3 and T_SVR6 to support since they don't terminate.

2) Morgan

2)	Pete
	1)	Added T_MMCDRV.

3)	Alastair
	1)	Fixed minor typo in T_BMA.


Version 0.01.015
================
(Made by Morgan, 26/8/99)

1)	Alastair
	1)	Added E32SDRV.PDD and E32SOUND.LDD, previously part of
		E32.
	2)	Added new keywords to various .MMP files so that .IBY files can be
		generated by ABLD TEST ROMFILE, also added extension makefile
		GROUP\ROMSTUFF.MKE.
	3)	Fixed WINS compilation problem in PCCD\T_PCCD3.CPP.
	4)	Added extension makefile GROUP\ROMUTIL.MKE, to incorporate required
		executables from E32UTILS into ROMS.  This is a temporary measure and
		should be undone once the executables in question are moved from
		E32UTILS into E32TEST.

2)	Pete
	1)	Changes to T_PCCD3 to allow it to work on Brutus.

3)	Chris
	1)	Added TestContiguousAllocation() to t_bma to test
		ImpMmu::RemoveRamPages().
	2)	Added t_fir2.
	3)	Tidied up T_Serial. Tested for Wins and Brutus.

4)	Dennis
	1)	Fixed structure packing problems in T_FARRAY with new GCC.
		Use 4-character arrays instead of 3 in the offending code.
	2)	Modified T_TLDD and D_LDD to test initialisation of .bss.
	3)	Various fixes to T_TPARSE.
	4)	Fixed operator precedence errors in T_TPARSE, T_ATADRV,
		T_ATDRV2, T_CRRDRV, T_IDRV, T_CHNOT.
	5)	Added __SWITCH_TO_ARM macros to some tests so that they can build
		for THUMB.

5)	Morgan
	1)	Renamed t_fircon2.cpp to (8.3) t_firco2.cpp


Version 0.01.014
================
(Made by Alastair, 2.8.1999)


1)	Alastair
	1)	Added ARMI, ARM4 and THUMB platforms to BLD.INF file.


Version 0.01.013
================
(Made by Dennis, 13.7.1999)

1)	Alastair
	1)	Added dopcvs.pl and lock.pl to GROUP directory for use with MNT.BAT.

2)	Dennis
	1)	Modified T_MESSGE, T_ARRAY to work with new GCC/THUMB.
	2)	Added tests to T_BUF to test variable precision TDes::Format() and
		precision applied to strings.
	3)	Modified MMP files for T_CALIB, T_COLOUR, T_PS, T_WJPWIN, T_WSIMP
		and T_WWINS to link against EWSRV.LIB instead of ECONS.LIB.
	4)	Removed tests of the form (boolean expr)==TRUE from T_R96.CPP.
	5)	Changed checked panic category in T_TRAP from USER-Plat to
		USER-Arch.
	6)	Took updated version of T_CHAR from Graham Asher to match new unicode
		collation scheme.
	7)	Changed status of some tests to 'support'.


Version 0.01.12
================
(Made by Alastair, 9.6.99)

1)	Malcolm
   	1)	Moved the *.rel files to e*.rel to match e32 and f32
		\group\*.rel
		\group\e*.rel

2)	Pete
	1) 	Modification to T_PCCDSK to allow the soak test buffer size to be input
		in units of a sector. Prior to this, the buffer size had to be input in
		units of 1Kbyte, with 8K being the largest size.
	2) 	Modified T_ATADRV - added additional tests to verify the operation of the
		functon TBusLocalDrive::Format(TInt aPos,TInt aLength). This allows just part
		of a disk to be formatted and was added to E32-181.
	3)	Added the new test program T_LFSDRV.CPP to test the LFS media driver on
		WINS/Brutus.
	4)	Added general media driver test T_MEDDRV and two associated media drivers
		- MEDT1.PDD and MEDT2.PDD.


3)	Alastair
	1)	Changed zips of releasables put onto the network. There is now one zip
		file for each platform containing full \Epoc32 paths to each item.
		There is also a zip file for exported header files.  Hence, the contents
		of S:\e32test\zip includes wins.<ver>, meig.<ver>, misa.<ver>, marm.<ver>
		mawd.<ver> and winc.<ver>.
		The files within these zip files now also have full pathnames so ensure
		you unzip them into the root of your EPOC drive with any flags required
		to recreate the directory structure.
		Added new command, MNT CHECKREL, to check that all releasables are
		present before doing an MNT PUTREL.
		Before doing MNT CHECKREL or MNT PUTREL call BLDMAKE -v RELFILES to
		create the lists of releasables.
	2)	Changed D_LDDNS.MMP and added BMARM\D_LDDNS.DEF to avoid new
		makmake warnings arising from LDD targettypes having the wrong second
		uid specified.
	3)	Replaced all B[plat].PRJ files for use with BLDMAKE with BLDMAKE.PRJ in
		accordance with ER5u bldmake changes.  No MAWD or SARM tests are now
		built in addition to the MARM tests - there doesn't seem to be any need
		since the __MAWD__ and __SINGLE__ macros haven't been used anywhere to
		build the test differently from the old standard MARM build.  Where
		tests do behave differently according to the h/w platform, if they do,
		then this should be tested at runtime and the behaviour of the test
		changed accordingly.
	4)	Removed superseded \E32TEST\GROUP\RUN.BAT.
	5)	Removed the batch files used for running tests.  These batch files are
		now created by BLDMAKE in \Epoc32\Bldmake\E32test\[platform]\, and are
		now called AUTO.BAT and MANUAL.BAT.
	6)	ETIMR and T_DEVC have been moved into this project from E32.
	7)	Removed all *.REL files from GROUP directory and changed MNT.BAT so that
		MNT PUTREL looks for .REL files generated by BLDMAKE instead.  Updated
		BLDMAKE.PRJ accordingly.
	8)	Changed #defines in the following files now that __MEIG__ is being used
		to mean __MARM__ and __MARM__ is being used to mean ARM CPU:
			SYSTEM\T_EXC.CPP, SYSTEM\T_DBG.CPP. 
	9)	Updated MNT GETBLD to fetch the SDMODELS component which replaces the
		SWINS component that E32 used to release.
	10)	Added the following .DEF files:-
			BWINS\
				D_TLSDLL.DEF, T_DLL.DEF, T_DLL1.DEF, T_DLL2.DEF,
				T_START1.DEF, T_START2.DEF, T_START3.DEF, T_DUID.DEF,
			BMARM\
				T_DLL.DEF, T_DLL1.DEF, T_DLL2.DEF, T_DLLA1.DEF, T_DLLA3.DEF,
				T_START1.DEF, T_START2.DEF, T_START3.DEF, T_DUID.DEF
	11)	Added \EPOC32\INCLUDE\KERNEL\ as a systeminclude path to those .MMP
		files requiring it.
	12)	Specified EKERN.LIB as an ASSPLIBRARY in those .MMP files requiring it.


Version 0.01.11
================
(Made by Jonathan, 23rd February 1999)

0)	Everyone
	1)	Boilerplated source.

1)	Dennis
	1)	Commented out tests in T_REALX involving assigning a NaN from a float
		or double to a TRealX in MSVC builds. This is because MSVC insists on
		passing the NaN through the X86 FPU which quietens the NaNs and causes
		the tests to fail.

2)	Morgan
	2)	Added test to check that switch-off is disabled for 5 seconds before
		an alarm is due.

3)	Jonathan
	1)	Withdrew T_RTIM test.
	2)	Made T_DBG build for MAWD as well as MARM. MAWD version doesn't
	  	contain assumptions about Eiger registers.


Version 0.01.10
================
(Made by Jonathan, 10th February 1999)

1)	Jonathan
	1)	Conditioned compilation of functions in T_PROT related to
	  	instruction exceptions on __EPOC32__ to prevent WINS/C warnings and
	  	fixed cast in ExceptionThread() to keep MSVC compiler happy.

2)	Morgan
	1)	Updated T_TLDD.
	2)	Added D_LDDNS.LDD which is an LDD with dodgy UID's.

3) 	Pete
	1) 	Modified BMAWD.PRJ to remove EIGER specific test programs.


Version 0.01.09
================
(Made by Pete, 3rd February 1999)

1)	Morgan
	1) 	More tests in T_TDLLA to test calling of Dll entrypoints with
		EProcessAttach and EThreadAttach
	2)	Added case switch on/off test

2)	Dennis
	1)	Updated T_PROT.CPP to test that data abort, prefetch abort and
		undefined instruction exceptions in user mode all result in
		KERN-EXEC 3 panics rather than killing the kernel.

3)	Jonathan
	1)	Added new tests to T_DBG to check that RDebug::ReadMemory and
	  	RDebug::WriteMemory return errors (and don't panic the kernel -
	  	problem EDN671244) when reading/writing to/from unmapped address
	  	space.

4)	Pete
	1)	Changed over to use the TBusLocalDrive class rather than TLocalDrive
		for local drive access. This in turn required converting calls to
		TBusLocalDrive::Caps() to take a TLocalDriveCapsBuf parameter rather
		than a TLocalDriveCaps.
	2)	Added T_ATDRV2.CPP to test TLocalDrive class specifically.



Version 0.01.08
================
(Made by Morgan, 27th January 1999)

1)	Dennis
	1)	Modified T_SOUND.CPP so it can be run on a Snowdrop.


Version 0.01.07
================
(Made by Pete, 21st December 1998)

1)	Alastair
	1)	Updated D_PATCH*.MMP to specify KPatchLddUid as third uid, in line with
		changes to F32 version 123.
	2)	Moved T_LDLL to F32TEST.
	3)	Minor modifications to MNT.BAT.
	4)	Minor change to T_REALX to avoid VC5 compilation problem.

2) Morgan
	1)	Killed SARMBE

3) Pete
	1) 	Modified T_PCCD1, T_PCCD2, T_PCCD3 to work with E32UTILS 025.
	2)  	Removed a call to a UserPcCardCntrl function which was removed from
		EUSER in E32-158. (The call was already redundant since the function
		has been withered for a while).
	3) Released MAWD releasables.


Version 0.01.06
================
(Made by Jonathan, 27th October 1998)

1) Dennis
	1)	Added code from Andrew Thoelke to T_DES.CPP to test compiler-generated
		literal descriptors.

2)	Alastair
	1)	Updated .MMP files so that UNICODE builds are available in line with 
		UNICODE changes to E32TOOLP 095.


Version 0.01.05
================
(Made by Morgan, 21st October 1998)

1)	Alastair
	1)	Changed WINS T_SERIAL.CPP to link to a new dll,
		D_TLSDLL.DLL, the entrypoint of which sets thread local storage.
		This will test whether the deadlock problem described by
		Epoc Proposal SW1 - 19 is avoided.  T_SOUND.CPP should link to
		this in the future.
	2)	Changed all the .rel files so that they specify T_DUID.DLL
		rather that non-existent T_DUID.EXE.
	3)	Removed T_ARRAY from AWINC.BAT since it isn't built or
		released under WINC.
	4)	Turned off just-in-time debugging in T_THREAD.CPP and T_PROC1.CPP where these
		tests panic threads and then check their status in WINS debug builds.
		Now that code jumps into the debugger whenever a thread is panicked (E32 152),
		rather than just whenever a thread is panicked with RThread::Panic(),
		these tests would have jumped into the debugger rather than completing successfully.

2)	Malcolm
	1)	Added new test program:
			T_Y2K.EXE - tests the Year 2000 compliance of E32


Version 0.01.04
================
(Made by Pete, 20/08/1998)

1) Dennis
	1)	Added new test programs:
			T_ARRAY.EXE - tests new RArray<> classes
			T_MWAIT.EXE - tests core clock and memory access speeds
			T_PROF.EXE - retrieves and displays thread profiling information
			D_PROF.LDD - LDD for use with T_PROF.EXE
			T_CTXSW.EXE - measures raw context-switch speed (not message passing)
			T_PAGES.EXE - dumps all MMU page tables to serial port
			T_PANIC.EXE - prints out a threads context when it dies
	2)	Modified T_CHUNK to test RChunk::IsReadable() and RChunk::IsWritable().
	3)	Added another test to T_MATH2.CPP to test the accuracy of Math::Mod() using
		the Java IEEERemainder test vector data.

2) Morgan
	1) Turned off just in time debugging in T_THREAD, T_MESSGE, and T_EXC
	2) Massaged T_TDLL.CPP for Dll MODULE_HANDLE changes

3) Matthew
	1)	Turned off just-in-time debugging in T_SOUND, and removed WINS test which
		is only valid when the driver does dummy recording.
	2)	Added test to T_SOUND to check that memory allocated in prepare functions
		is recoverable.
	3)	Changed T_SOUND so that it passes (with warnings) on hardware which
		doesn't support all possible capabilities.
	4)	Switched off just-in-time debugging in T_TIMER.

4) Petteri
	1) Changed .mmp files D_LDLL, D_RTIM, T_DLLA1 and T_DLLA3

5)	Alastair
	1)	Changed t_reset test so that it checks that 3 dummy patch ldds
		are reloaded after a warm reset.  Added dummy patch ldds D_PATCH1.SYS,
		D_PATCH2.SYS and D_PATCH3.SYS.
	2)	Minor changes to T_SVR.CPP, T_MSTIM.CPP to remedy compilation
		warnings.
	3)	Change to T_CHUNK2.CPP for !WINC builds to allow for E32 change in total
		RAM size to 64Mb under WINS in E32 141.
	4)	Updated T_CHAR.CPP to take account of Graham Asher's changes to E32 141.
	5)	Fixed MNT GETSRC so that it handles version numbers correctly.
	6)	Minor corrections to T_THREAD.CPP.

6)	Peter
	1)	Added T_PCCDSR to PCCD. This is a program for
		repeatly writing to a fixed number of sectors on a CF card - to test
		if the wear leveling scheme on the card causes any problems.
	2)	Modified T_PCCD1.CPP,T_PCCD2.CPP and T_PCCD3.CPP to
		use D_PCCDIF.LDD for accessing the PC Card Contoller rather than
		UserPcCardCntrl.
	3)	Modified T_CRMDRV.CPP to use D_DRVIF.LDD for direct
		access of the media device rather than UserPcCardCntrl.
	4)	Modified T_PCCDSK.CPP to use
		UserSvr::ForceRemountMedia() rather than UserPcCardCntrl::PwrDown();
	5) 	Added further tests to T_ATADRV - testing reads and writes 
		which are longer than the media drivers local buffer 
		- particularly required after the changes to the ATA
		media driver in E32-143.


Version 0.01.03
================
(Made by Graham, 26th March 1998)

1) Morgan
	1) Added T_TLDD and D_LDD to test LDD static data.  EPOC only.
	2) Modified Dll static data tests (T_TDLLA).  Added MiniRomLoader
	   and reload tests.

2) Alastair
	1) Changed MNT.BAT to retrieve E32TOOLS 091 and E32TOOLP 091.

3) Matthew
	1) Changes Test6() and Test8() in T_COBJ to use less stack and
	   hence build on WINS/WINC without __chkstk errors.

	2) Changed D_RTIM and D_BEXFIQ interrupt binding to use narrow
	   descriptors, in order to work with E32 127 and higher.

	3) Removed User::After(999999) from T_CHNOT, to speed it up. This
	   wait is not needed, since midnight-crossover changes now happen
	   earlier than they used to.

	4) Changed T_CHUNK2 so that it did something more sensible on WINC,
	   where the concept of "free ram" is different.

	5) Changed T_REGRAM so that is disables auto switch-off while running.

	6) Fixed a few incorrect tests in T_THREAD.


Version 0.01.02
================
(Made by Jonathan, 10th February 1998)

1) Alastair
	1) Changed t_sec.cpp to test new security function for E32.  The
	   function will only be tested if the version of E32 being used
	   supports the new function, so that the new version of t_sec.cpp
	   will still work with old versions of E32.

2) Petteri
        1) Added the test program T_COLOUR to test the new
           colour text window server.

3) Graham
        1) Reoved kernel heap checking fro a number of tests. We need
           to rethink our strategy for this since the current system
           is clearly broken

        2) Removed superfluous operator attendance from T_TIMER,
           T_COBJ.

        3) Added AMARM.BAT, AWINS.BAT, etc which run all the
           automatic tests fro a given platform.


Version 0.01.01
================
(Made by Graham, 23rd January 1998)

E32TEST contains those test programs which used to be a part of E32

1)  Some renaming:
     drvbench -> t_pccdbm, drvsoak -> t_pccdsk and more

2)  Known problems:
     t_svr2 fails due to heap debugging code errors on MARM
     t_cobj won't compile for WINS - needs stack use reducing
	 t_tdll,t_rtim and t_irqs seem to fail
