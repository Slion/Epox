THIS RELEASE NOTE NO LONGER IN USE

See \F32\GROUP\RELEASE.TXT for changes to F32TEST


Version 2.00.520
================
(Made by MichaelP, 27/08/2004)

1)	JonathanM
	1)	Removed WINS specific test from T_DIRS. (Testing for exact contents
		of z:\sys\bin\ is too fragile and serves no real purpose.)


Version 2.00.519
================
(Made by DjordjeK, 18/08/2004)

1)	Pete
	1) 	MINOR_CHANGE Fixed a problem in WINTEST which meant that the ESTART map 
		file for WINS wasn't always copied to the correct place.

2)	Kamran
	1) 	fixed problems in t_falsespace

3)	AndrewJ
	1)	Edited loader security test so that it only tests hashing in the loader. Made it 
		take a command line parameter to specify the removable drive that the test will 
		use. If the drive specified (by run test) is not removable the test will exit
		without running test cases.
	2)	Added the all the security tests to the /f32test/group/bld.inf file by inlcuding
		the renamed version of the /f32test/loader/bld.inf. So all security loader tests
		run from f32test script. Made required changes to the mmp files.

Version 2.00.518
================
(Made by KamranN, 04/08/2004)

1)	KamranN
	1)	Addition of t_falseSpace test for purpose of testing submission of PREQ133

		C: is bigger than system RAM

2)      AndrewHi
	1)	MS3.7.2 Sierra Nevada PREQ 729 (part 2 of 2) and PREQ 537 (part 2 of 2)

Version 2.00.513
================
(Made by StefanW, 09/01/2004)
1)      StephanGu
        1)      Fixed defect - DEF040848 - T_DSPACE fails on drive K:. Test
                code was incorrect.
        2)      Fixed defect - DEF040850 - T_NOTIFY.EXE fails.  Test code was

Version 2.00.512
================
(Made by JonathanM, 05/12/2003)

1)	ChrisCr
	1)	DEF001193 - (Propagated) Files with scandic letters in the name might
		be deleted during boot.
	2)	MINOR_CHANGE - B_FAT and B_FAT32 tests are not valid on ramdrive, cause
		them to exit if run on ramdrive.
	3)	DEF015608 - CDirScan::NextL leaves when trying to scan \private and
		\system directory.

2)	JonathanM
	1)	Made T_SCNDR1 and T_SCNDR2 manual tests to avoid duplication of testing
		(T_SCN32DR1 and T_SCN32DR2 perform the same testing.)

		to 1000 so that it will fill the root dir for all versions fat except fat32.
	3)	Changed the default format type in f32tests to quick format so that full format
		must be specified if required such as in specifi format test t_format. 


Version 2.00.510
================
(Made by JonathanM, 24/09/2003)

1.	AndrewJ
	1.	Added test cases to test t_rcount to test defect "DEF002614  File crashes 
		when passed a broken subsession handle" is fixed in new file server

2.	StephanGu
	1.	Changed capability tests, t_fsys and t_ext1 to not run on the NAND
		user area, as they do not handle primary extensions.  
		NAND flash support added as per PREQ12 (REQ1752) NandFlash on EKA2.

Version 2.00.509
================
(Made by JonathanM, 05/08/2003)

1)	Raja Shekar Reddy
	1)	CR CANY-5JQFM3 "Enable e32/f32 test suite to be used from a CustKit or DevKit 
		installation". For Typhoon most of the changes were winc specific files.

2)	Dennis
	1)	Changed T_DLOCL to use UserSvr::ChangeLocale(_L("")) to restore the default
		settings rather than loading ELOCL_BASE, which no longer exists.



Version 2.00.508
================
(Made by JonathanM, 19/05/2003)

1)	JonathanM and ChrisM
	1)	Changes resulting from making E32 compatible with with

Version 2.00.507
================
(Made by ChrisM, 17/03/2003)
1)	AndrewJ
	1)	Added 5 tests specifically for rofs, they only run on J and V: (and are not 
		t_main.cpp based) for rofs on wins and hardware respectively. The test do not
		run as part of the automatic test set. but are included in an F32test rom. Note 
		you need to copy a rofs image to the correct partition to run the tests.
2)	JonathanM
	1)	Modified T_TLIBRY and T_TLINK to not run when Data Caging is enabled.
		(Because they try and test non Data Caging complient behaviour.)

3)	Nicolas
	1)	Fixed bugs in T_LDRCHECK, T_FILE and T_NOTIFY: test assertions
		using '=' instead of '=='.
4)	Markdo
	1)	Modified T_FMAN so that when testing max length filenames codewarrior uses
		a path length of two characters less (\epoc32\winscw\c vs \epoc32\wins\c).
		
5)	PeteS
	1)	Changed T_NOTIFY to use RLocalDrive::IsRemovable() rather than
		RLocalDrive::MediaDevice() to determine socket number.

Version 2.00.506
================
(Made by JonathanM, 14/01/2003)

1)	Markdo
	1) 	Updated tests due to various failures.
	2) 	Reduced the number of iterations performed by T_SESS.

2)	ChrisCr
	1)	Updated tests T_LFFS, LFFSINFO and T_DSPACE to use the 'symbianised'
		LFFS to the coding standards (names of classes and member variables
		using ControlIo).  Removed duplicate copy of lffs_controlio.h (and use
		the one in the LFFS code, specified with a relative path).

3)	Nicolas
	1)	Removed RDebug test code as there is no generic user-side debug 
		API in EKA2.


Version 2.00.505
================
(Made by AndrewT, 29/10/2002)

1)	JonathanM
	1)	Removed all usage of RProcess::SecureApi and User::RemoveCapabilities.

	3)	Modified tests to use T_MAIN (T_SCNDR1, T_SCNDR2, T_SCNDR3, T_SOAK1).
	4)	Modified ControlIO to enforce use of TDes8 parameters as required by the secure kernel (This affected the 
		tests LFFSINFO, T_SOAK, T_DSPACE, T_HUNGFS).
2)	CiprianM
	1)	Modified T_NMBS to take into account fix for defect EXT-5AKDAM 
		"RFs: Folders with trailing dots cause big problems in the Flash
		File system and applications that use the file system".
	2)	Modified T_MISC to test for fix to defect EXT-57KH9K "RFs file server
 		session crashes with null pointer access with IsValidName() method!".
	3)	Modified T_MMC due to changes from f32 defect fix DON-585E4C "Memory
 		card password file shown in dialogs".
	4)	Modified T_FMAN to test fix for defect EXT-5BMC53 "CFileMan::Copy() reports wrong
		for error for non-existent matching names".
	5)	Modified T_NOTIFY to test fix for defect EXT-5BMC53 "CFileMan::Copy() reports wrong
		for error for non-existent matching names".
	6)	Fixed defect FOD-5CKDV6 "Checkdisk failure during autotests required user
 		feedback".

3)	Andrewj
	1)	Changed all data caging tests to (start t_dc*) to have correct capabilities and use a helper exe for 
		test setup and cleanup.
	2)	Added exe clean_prepdc.exe to setup and tidyup after datacaging tests
	3) 	Changed the position of t_prel in the ROM to system bin

4)	ChrisCr

Version 2.00.503
================
(Made by JonathanM, 20/09/2002)

1)	AndrewT
	1)	Removed T_RDFAT from the test suite. This is a legacy test that is no longer required

Version 2.00.502
================
(Made by Nicolas, 16-09-2002)

1)	Nicolas
	1)	Fixed DEF000090 - E32TEST MMP files should not specify

		card password file shown in dialogs".
	3)	Modified T_FMAN so that when testing max length filenames codewarrior uses
		a path length of two characters less (\epoc32\winscw\c vs \epoc32\wins\c).

2)	MarkCa
	1)	Updated on-screen instructions in T_MMC to ask user to press F4 twice if
		using card 1.  This change is necessary because of E32 CR PHAR-54RJMT.

Version 0.01.090
================
(Made by ChrisM, 06/03/2002)

1)	AndrewJ
	1)	Amended T_Notify as it was checking wrong TRequestStatus

2)	Markdo
	1)	Fixed defect FID-572FMM "T_SOAK has garbage value for default drive".
	2)	Modified T_MMC to account for changes made to f32 by change request
		MDON-57HLDW "RFs::LockDrive() should not allow user to not store
		password"



Version 0.01.089
================
(Made by RobertJ, 11/02/2002)

1)	MarkCa
	1)	Disabled T_SCNDR(1|2), B_FAT and T_FSYS from running on
		Cirrus.

Version 0.01.088
================
(Made by PeterS,  04/02/2002)

1)	MarkCa
	1)	Extended T_FSYS to check fix FID-562G4V (App can kill F32 by attempting
		to mount filesystem on unsupported drive.)
	2)	Fixed FID-556JEX (T_PROC tries to use drive D:)  T_PROC now uses the
		default drive.

2)	Markdo
	1)	Modified T_NOTIFY to test fix for defect BEN-4YRGKV "Ecom not recognising
		plugins once unplugged and replugged".

Version 0.01.087
================
(Made by AndrewJ,  12/12/2001)

1)	Nicolas
	1)	Modified T_DLLSTATIC test so that it works on WINC and
		is not wrongly reported as failed when run from
		eruntest.

2)	Markdo
	1)	Added the test T_WRITEP which checks that all operations that cause a
		write to disk fail with KErrAccessDenied when the media driver is write
		protected. Added to check the fix for the defect DON-4ZKD9H "File server
		does not fully support	write-protected media".

3)	Andrew
	1)	Modified T_RAW to take into account new behaviour of RFormat and 
		RRawDisk from fixing defect JON-53BMJZ "RRawDisk de-references a null
		pointer when used on a corrupt drive (due to forced a mount)".

	1)	Updated T_OOM to test fix DON-4V7BUZ (KErrNoMemory cannot be
		returned on c:)

Version 0.01.086
================
(Made by MichaelP, 20/11/2001)

	1)	Fixed MET-53LG56 (Minor inconsistancies in T_TSCAN.CPP.)  Changed
		CleanDirectory() and ExpandDirectory() to add integer number of
		clusters to directories.		

2)	RobertJ
	1)	Added t_bcache to benchmark loader improvements resulting from caching.
		Should be run from a refui image, not from a text shell. The timings are
		given as untranslated fastcount ticks. To see what the timings would be
		without the cache, comment out "#define __USE_LOADER_CACHE_"
		in \f32\sfile\sf_ldr.cpp and rebuild.

	2)	Added t_cache to test that the cache is delivering the correct file name
		to the loader. Various strategies are employed to test that the cache
		is maintaining coherency. Also tested is load from rom run from ram.
		The test is classified as manual because all media slots should be
		populated before test begins.

3)	Markdo
	1)	Fixed defect ROS-53FLTJ "F32TEST T_LDLL doesn't build for WINSCW". Fixed
		using the current MODULE_HANDLE definitions from EUSER. Fix allows 
		additional test to be carried out in T_TLIBRY on WINS which had previously
		been excluded using #if defined (__EPOC32__).
	2)	Modified WINTEST.BAT to take into account WINSCW.


Version 0.01.085
================
(Made by Dennis,  26/10/2001)

1)	MarkCa
	1)	Moved definitions from P32MMC.H into T_MMC.CPP because it can only be
		included in ASSP-specific builds.  See \e32\release.txt.

2)	Nicolas
	1)	Added T_DLLSTATIC and support files to test static
		data in DLLs.
	2)	Added SERVER\FILECOPY.CPP containing a function
		(CopyFile()) to copy files from Z:\ to C:\.  Updated
		T_DEBUGGER to use that function.


Version 0.01.084
================
Made by ChrisM, 05/10/2001

1)	MarkCa
	1)	Added t_mvdr to test fix DON-4ZKDKK (Moving a directory leads to
		incorrect parent directory cluster number.)  This is a manual test that
		creates and moves / renames a set of directories.  Run on a formatted
		card and then check the card with a disk verification utility.
	2)	Changed t_chlffs to recognize Integrator LFFS on K: instead of D:.

2)	Markdo
	1)	Fixed defect MAY-4ZMMZY "F32Tests for LFFS require Cat-A code to build"
		and MAY-4ZMMXC "F32test server\t_dspace cannot be built by
		licencee". Necessary header file copied from f32 to f32test.


Version 0.01.083
================
Made by AndrewT, 31/08/2001

1)	MarkCa
	1)	Modified T_CHLFFS to mount LFFS on drive d for Integrator.

2)	CarlosF
	1)	Changed the t_chlffs.cpp to allow tests to run on Assabet when FAT is

		to ensure that test behaves correctly when sectors/cluster > 1. 

2)	WillR
	1)	Correct reinterpret_cast to remove CodeWarrior warning

3)	TimBa
	1)	Added new test project T_FileMatch (.mpp and .cpp) to test some real
		examples of filenames in various languages. Wanted by Linda
		Enhancements.

4)	MarkCa
	1)	Moved T_PWSTR from f32test to e32test.  F32 API tested by T_MMC.

5)	Nicolas
	1)	Updated debugger tests as part of fixing MAY-4V4E5V
	  	(Breakpoints don't work on ARM architecture 5
	  	processors).

6)	Pete
	1) 	Removed \f32test\group\mnt.bat which was redundant.
	2) 	Modification to T_FSYS.EXE to add an additional test for the
		function RFs::RemountDrive().

Version 0.01.081
================
Made by Michael, 21/06/2001

1)	MarkDo
	1)	Increased the stack size of T_SCNDR2 to 0x4000.
	2)	Modified T_MAIN-based tests to test with a hung file server. T_MAIN
		now takes command-line arguments:

		HANG - run tests with a non-critical password notifier up for 
		duration of the test.
		
		REPEAT - Runs only on d: for epoc platforms and x: for WINS. Every file 
		server request causes the non-critical password notifier to come up
		and complete in a random time with a specified	password. This
		should be used simultaneosly with WITHREPEAT, each being called from
		a separate RUNTESTS process.

		WITHREPEAT - To be used in conjunction with REPEAT. Default path should
		not be a removable media.
	3)	Introduced T_HUNGFS to test critical and non-critical notifiers. This
		test is only to be run on non-removable media and requires input from
		the user.
	4)	Added batch file \F32TEST\SERVER\F32TEST_REPEAT.BAT to be used as
		RUNTESTS batch file when using REPEAT and WITHREPEAT command-line
		arguments(see above).

2)	MarkCa
	1)	Modified t_fsrv, t_mmc and t_pwstr to handle e32 fixes EDNHLJT-4WZGTD
		and EDNHAAO-4WZFYR.
	2)	Implemented CR PSCE-4VMP3K to set hard limit for RAM drive.  T_OOM
		extended to fill up ram drive when limit set.

3)	Nicolas
	1)	Fixed thumb bug in t_debuggee_1 (least significant bit
	  	of text base address passed to t_debugger was not
	  	cleared).

Version 0.01.080
================
Made by Carlos, 31/05/2001

1)	Markdo
	1)	Modified T_FILE to take account for changes made in DON-4VWCWG

		handle mis-management crashes the kernel)

2)	Dennis
	1)	Modified tests which require a D: drive not to run the relevant part
		on IQ80310 (similar to checks for Cogent already there).

	1)	Added T_RESIZE test to test bug fix EDNMDON-4J2EWK.
		edit: group\bld.inf; add: group\t_resize.mmp server\t_resize.cpp
		Test program classified as manual because takes long time to run
		(creates 10Mb file) and needs FAT disk with at least 10Mb free.

Version 0.01.059
================
(Made by MarkCa, 16/05/00)

1)	Markdo
	1)	Removed compiler warnings.
	2)	Changes to T_TLINK to compensate for loss of registry.

2)	MarkCa
	1)	Modified Brutus but non-LFFS tests to cleanly abort when running
		on LFFS drive.  Some T_MAIN based tests (exc T_LOADER.CPP) did this
		anyway but an extra "CallTestsL: Skipped: test does not run on LFFS.\n"
		msg was added (B_FAT.CPP, T_LOADER.CPP, T_RAW.CPP, T_COMPAT.CPP).
		For tests not based on T_MAIN, an extra function IsDefaultDriveLFFS()
		was added to T_CHLFFS.CPP, with its prototype in T_CHLFFS.H.
		An additional function IsNamedDriveLFFS() was added for T_FSRV, which
		is T_MAIN based and needs to perofrm extra checking volume name.
		If the E32Main routine discovers it is running on an LFFS drive then
		it prints "E32Main: Skipped: test does not run on LFFS.\n" and returns.
		(T_APPINS.CPP, T_DLOCL.CPP, T_FIND.CPP, T_GEN.CPP, T_GEN32.CPP,
		T_LDR.CPP, T_PARSE.CPP, T_PROC.CPP, T_RDSECT.CPP, T_RCOUNT.CPP,
		T_SCNDR1.CPP, T_SCNDR2.CPP, T_SESS.CPP, T_TLIBRY.CPP, T_TLINK.CPP)
		In T_ROMG, code was reordered in CMemDir::LoadDirL() to avoid a
		NULL dereference.

Version 0.01.058
================
(Made by Morgan, 7/4/2000)

1)    Nicolas
      1)	Added T_DEBUGGER and its support files (application
		debugging tests).  These tests are no more in E32TEST
		because F32 is needed to copy the suppport
		files to the RAM-disk. 

2)	MarkCa
	1)	\F32TEST\GROUP\BLD.INF
		\F32TEST\GROUP\T_PWSTR.MMP
		\F32TEST\SERVER\T_PWSTR.CPP
		Manual test program to test password store (WINS only).

3)	Pete
	1)	Changes to support F32 tests on LFFS drives. This involves changes to
		most files.
	2) 	Added T_DNOTIF to test F32 debug notifiers.

Version 0.01.057
================
(Made by MarkDo, 30.03.200)

1)	MarkDo
	1)	Added T_MMC to test locking of a device.


Version 0.01.056
================
(Made by ???, ???)

1)	Pete
	1) 	Removed calls of UserPcCardCntrl::PwrDown();
	2) 	Modified serial test so that it is possible to
		overide the default serial port designated to be used
		by that test by supplying a serial port number on the
		command line:-
			- T_TERM p1


Version 0.01.055
================
(Made by Alastair, 10.3.2000)

1)	MarkDo
	1)	Modified T_FSRV and T_SESS so that battery state of EBatNotSupported
		is a valid.

Version 0.01.054
================
(Made by MarkCa 03-03-00)

1)	Morgan
	1)	Removed use of the registry from T_TLIBRY in anticipation
		of the the registry being deleted.

Version 0.01.052
================
(Made by Dennis, 14-02-2000)

1)	Dennis
	1)	Replaced most UserHal:: calls with corresponding HAL:: calls (if they
		exist).

2)	Mark
	1)	Added SCNDRV\T_SCNDR1-2-3 tests. T_SCNDR1 tests that the scandrive
		utility fixes specific errros in the fat/metadata. T_SCNDR2 and
		T_SCNDR3 test that the rugged fat file system prevents the fat/
		metadata from being corrupted in the event of a power failure. Both
		simulate power failure by failing writes in the TDriver class. In
		T_SCNDR2 an error value is returned on failure whilst in T_SCNDR3
		the machine is reset.
	2)	Minor change to T_FIND since ESHELL.EXE is not fixed process.
	3)	Cleaned up PRELOAD.LST since T_PREL.DLL was not being preloaded.


Version 0.01.051

	2)	Switched T_REMOTE to a manual test.
	3)	Change to T_FSRV to correctly test for unicode volume names.
	4)	Change to T_RDSECT to more accurately test CRomMountCB::ReadSectionL.
	5)	Added test\t_tlibry.exe to romtarget in T_TLIBRY.MMP so this test
		is included in rom.

2)	Dennis
	1)	Removed calls to EUSER functions which no longer exist.


Version 0.01.017
================
(Made by Morgan, 26/8/99)

1)	Pete
	1)	Changes to T_NOTIFY to now test media change notification on multiple
		PC Card sockets.
	2)	Fixed up T_FIND - find channel test to work with Brutus serial drivers.

2)	Dennis
	1)	Fix to T_SESFS.CPP - don't logon to a thread if we failed to create it!
	2)	Removed various redundant copies of files in \F32TEST\FSSTRESS from
		\F32TEST\SERVER.
	3)	Fixed operator precedence errors in T_FMAN.CPP.

3)	Alastair
	1)	Added new keywords to various .MMP files so that .IBY files can be
		generated by ABLD TEST ROMFILE, also added extension makefile
		GROUP\ROMSTUFF.MKE.


Version 0.01.016
================
(Made by Alastair, 2.8.1999)

1)	Mark
	1)	Added two new support dlls t_loclus and t_loclge for t_dlocl. These replace
		the original localisation dlls locl.us and locl.ge. Changes made to t_dlocl
		to reflect this. Uncommented localisation tests in t_dlocl.
	2)	Modified t_nofify to take into account unicode handling of volume names.
	3)	Moved t_alert to manual.bat.
	4)	Converted Preload.lst used for t_libry to unicode.
	5)	Converted t_warm to manual.bat
	6)	Modified b_open so that when creating a large file the memory left free is
		dependent on the size of the ram.

2)	Alastair
	1)	Added ARMI, ARM4 and THUMB platforms to BLD.INF file.


Version 0.01.015
================
(Made by Dennis 13.7.1999)

1)	Alastair
	1)	Added dopcvs.pl and lock.pl to GROUP directory for use with MNT.BAT.

2)	Mark
	1)	Modified t_fsrv so that RFs::SetVolumeName is tested under unicode
		(see ER5 bug EDNWROS-45WGVY).
	2)	Modified b_fat to test that an ascii directory entry is read in
		unicode builds (see ER5 bug EDN028229).
	3)	Added \epoc32\include\kernel to SYSTEMINCLUDE in t_warm.mmp.


Version 0.01.14
===============
(Made by Alastair, 9.6.99)

1)	Mark	
	1)	Added test program t_fsys to test the new functions FileSystemName(..)
		and DismountFileSystem(..) in class RFs.
	2)	Added a dummy file system t_testfsys to be used by t_fsys on epoc platforms.

2)	Pete
	1)	Added T_LFFS for testing the LFFS file system.
	2)	Added F32 soak test program T_SOAK1.

3)	Alastair
	1)	Changed zips of releasables put onto the network. There is now one zip
		file for each platform containing full \Epoc32 paths to each item.
		There is also a zip file for exported header files.  Hence, the contents
		of S:\f32test\zip includes wins.<ver>, marm.<ver> and winc.<ver>.
		The files within these zip file now also have full pathnames so ensure
		you unzip them into the root of your EPOC drive with any flags required
		to recreate the directory structure.
		Added new command, MNT CHECKREL, to check that all releasables are
		present before doing an MNT PUTREL.
		Before doing MNT CHECKREL or MNT PUTREL call BLDMAKE -v RELFILES to
		create the lists of releasables.
	1)	Replaced all B[plat].PRJ files for use with BLDMAKE with BLDMAKE.PRJ in
		accordance with ER5u bldmake changes.
	2)	Removed all superseded RUN.BAT files.
	3)	Removed the batch files used for running tests.  These batch files are
		now created by BLDMAKE in \Epoc32\Bldmake\E32test\[platform]\, and are
		now called AUTO.BAT and MANUAL.BAT.
	4)	Removed all *.REL files from GROUP directory and changed MNT.BAT so that
		MNT PUTREL looks for .REL files generated by BLDMAKE instead.  Updated
		BLDMAKE.PRJ accordingly.
	5)	Updated MNT GETBLD to fetch the SDMODELS component which replaces the
		SWINS component that E32 used to release.
	6)	Added the following .DEF files:-
			BWINS\
				T_LIBRY.DEF, T_LDLL.DEF, T_PREL.DEF.
			BMARM\
				T_LIBRY.DEF, T_LDLL.DEF, T_PREL.DEF, T_LINKD.DEF, T_LINKC.DEF,
				T_LINKB.DEF, T_LINKA.DEF, T_LINKDF.DEF, T_LINKCF.DEF,
				T_LINKBF.DEF, T_LINKAF.DEF, T_LINKE.DEF, T_MUTC.DEF, T_DUPD.DEF,
				T_LOOPB.DEF, T_LOOPC.DEF, T_LOOPD.DEF.
	7)	Renamed t_testfsys.mmp t_tfsys.mmp for 8.3 filename compliance.





Version 0.01.13
===============
(Made by Jonathan, 23rd February 1999)

0)	Everyone
	1)	Boilerplated source.

1)	Morgan
	1)	Added "load device driver from RAM", and "ignore old Device driver
		in RAM" tests to T_TLIBRY.
	2)	Added test to T_TLINK to test that Dlls that have been previously
		loaded from Rom can be sucessfully fixed-up to Dlls loaded from Ram.

2)	Mark
	1)	Modified T_APPINS and T_NOTIFY to take account of the change to
		RFs::NotifyChange() in F32-131.


Version 0.01.12
===============
(Made by Morgan, 27th January 1999)

1)	Jo
	1) Modified t_ramstr to test diagnostic debug checking
	

Version 0.01.11
===============
(Made by Jo, 19th January 1999)

1)	Jo
	1)	Additional testing in T_NOTIFY to test new functionality added to fileserver notification

	2)	Additional test, T_APPINS also tests new fileserver notification requests

2)	Morgan
	1)	Additional test in T_TLIBRY


Version 0.01.10
===============
(Made by Jo, 13th January 1999)

1) Alastair
	1)	Removed BLD.BAT, CLEAN.BAT and PREPARE.BAT from Group\Li.prj.

2) Jo
	1)	Added a new test T_RENAME to directory \SERVER\
		Tests the bug fix in F32 126 ("Rename creates duplicate file").

	2)	Created a new directory \FSSTRESS\ in which all file-server stress
	  	tests have been placed. These are currently T_REMOTE, T_SESS and a
	  	new test, T_RAMSTR, which stress tests the RAM drive by creating,
	  	renaming, replacing and deleting multiple files.

	A new set of batch files, AMARMSTR.bat etc have been created so the
	stress tests can be run separately (since they all run for a
	deliberately extended period). The tests t_remote and t_sess have not
	been removed from the standard test batch files however, since they
	should be run prior to each F32 release. T_RAMSTR has been created to
	help simulate the conditions in which an F32 bug is suspected to arise
	and is not currently part of the standard F32 test suite.

3)	Morgan
	1)	Extended T_TLINK to test different link trees. New dll's for this
		are T_LOOP[B|C|D].DLL, TMUTC.DLL, TDUPD.DLL


Version 0.01.09
================
(Made by Jo, December 8th 1998)

1) Jo
	1)	Added an extra test to \bench\t_fsysbm to benchmark multiple file deletes
	2)	Modified t_notify in the light of a change to the file notification code

2) Morgan
	1) Extended T_TLIBRY to do LDD RAM-load tests


Version 0.01.08
================
(Made by Jo, December 1st 1998)

1) Morgan
	1)	Added Load by uid tests and updated T_LIBRY.DLL to have Uids
	2)	Added T_TLINK.EXE and supporting dlls T_LINK<A|B|C|D>[f].DLL
		to test loader re-tries.  This test is for __EPOC32__ only.
	3)	Fiddled with T_TLIBRY.CPP to re-instigate some commented out
		tests.
	4)	Killed SARMBE

2)	Alastair
	1)	Moved T_LDLL into F32TEST from E32TEST, since F32TEST's T_TLIBRY seems
		to be the only test which requires it, and F32TEST shouldn't be dependent upon
		releasables from E32TEST.
	2)	Minor modifications to MNT.BAT.

3)	Jo
	1)	Minor modification to T_DIRS to re-incorporate filetime testing


Version 0.01.07
================
(Made by Jonathan, 27th October 1998)

1)	Alastair
	1)	Updated .MMP files so that UNICODE builds are available in line with 
		UNICODE changes to E32TOOLP 095.
	2)	Changed T_CHKUID.EXE so that it checks for and has 0x1000007a rather 
		than 1 as its first UID.
	3)	Changed T_FIND.EXE so that it checks for UNICODE versions of
		KConsoleDllUidValue and KLocaleDllUidValue in UNICODE builds.


Version 0.01.06
================
(Made by Morgan, 21st October 1998)

1)	Alastair
	1)	Fixed T_LOCATE so that it runs under WINC.
	2)	Changed T_SESS so that it's less biased towards a particular
		PC configuration.
	3)	Added \F32TEST\GROUP\WINTEST2.BAT which sets up test files so
		that F32's tests can test the emulator when it's not run from
		a traditional \epoc32\release\win... directory.

2)	Jo
	1)	Added extra tests within T_FMAN to test the F32 changes to cope with
	extra long pathnames.

	2)	Minor change to B_FAT to allow for the change to the number of directory 
	entries F32 allocates when the VFAT name is an exact multiple of 13
	characters.

	3)	Minor change to T_RDSECT for UNICODE MARM builds

Version 0.01.05
================
(Made by Jo, 18th September 1998)

Requires F32 >= 120

1) Jo

	1) Added test \SERVER\T_RDSECT to test new RFs function ReadFileSection()

	2) Additional tests added to \SERVER\T_NOTIFY to test new overloads to the RFs
	functions RFs::NotifyChange and RFs::NotifyChangeCancel().
	
	3) Extra test added to \SERVER\T_MISC to test new RFs function overload
	RFs::IsValidName().

	4) Additional test in \SERVER\T_FILE to check EPOC software problem SW1-123
	("WINS Local file system doesn't handle shared read and write access").
	T_FILE calls TestShortNameAccessorFunctions() successfully in UNICODE builds now the
	RFs functions GetShortName() and GetLongName() are implemented for UNICODE (see F32
	release notes).
	
	5) Additional testing in \SERVER\T_FSRV to test fix to RFs::SetVolumeLabel() and
	fix of bluebell defect SW1-728 (see below).
	
	6) Additional testing in \SERVER\T_NMBS to check fix of EPOC software problem
	SW1-56 ("File can be turned into a directory").

	7) Addition to (and modification of) \SERVER\B_GEN to check fix of bluebell
	defect SW1-728 ("'Name Disk' allows characters which are illegal under windows").
	B_GEN now passes in UNICODE builds due to fix to RFs::SetVolumeLabel() - See F32
	release notes	

	8) Changes to \SERVER\B_FAT to get it working in UNICODE builds.  The test was
	making a number of assumptions about the number of TFatDirEntrys created per
	file that were false for UNICODE. 

	Additional test (TestClusterAllocation()) to fix to Series 5 problem SW1-764
	"F32 over-allocates clusters"
	
	Modified testRoot() to test fix to Series 5 problem SW1-770
	"Can't handle the last root directory entry"
	
	9) \SERVER\T_FMAN now works in UNICODE builds due to fix to size of KEntryArraySize
	(see F32 release notes) 

	Extra testing to check fix to Series 5 problems SW1-230 (" F32 allows names of
	>256 chars and then panics with them"), SW1-351 ("Shell hangs forever trying to
	delete files/folders with impossibly long names") and SW1-821 ("Invalid file
	names stop CDirScan")
	
	10) Additional testing in \SERVER\T_DIRS to check fix of EPOC software problem
	SW1-29 ("Local/System filetime confusion"). This has been partially removed for
	this release because the fix hasn't been released in F32 - awaiting verification.

	11) Minor modifications/additions to T_RDFAT, B_MTST, T_CHKUID, T_FORMAT, T_SCAN
	and T_VFAT (in general, to improve the clarity of the tests).


Version 0.01.04
================
(Made by Jo, 15th July 1998)

Requires F32 >= 110

1)  Alastair
	
	1) Changed MNT.BAT to retrieve E32TOOLS 091 and E32TOOLP 091.
    2) Minor change to T_WARM to remedy WINS/WINC compilation warning.
	3) Commented out localisation data tests in T_DLOCL since we don't
	   release the localisation dlls anymore; added commands to
	   F32TEST\GROUP\WINTEST.BAT to create dummy localisation dlls.
	4) Fixed MNT GETSRC so that it handles version numbers correctly.
	5) Removed some tests from the WINC versions of T_CHKUID and
	   T_ROMG programs where these tests relied upon some sort of emulated
	   directory structure which doesn't really make sense under WINC.
	6) Changed B_FAT,T_COMPAT, T_DIRS, T_FILE, T_FMAN, T_FORMAT,
	   T_FSRV, T_RAW and T_MAIN under WINC in line with changes
	   to F32 111 causing the WINC default directory to be taken
	   from the current directory.
	7) Changed WINC versions of T_DIRS T_FSRV in line with changes 
	   to F32 111 allowing WINC programs write access to Z: drive.
	8) Removed WINC test from T_FSRV which assumes D: is a CDROM drive.
	9) Removed WINC tests from T_FSRV (testVolumeInfo())and 
	   T_MISC (Test 13) which expects all drives A-Z to
	   be available for WINC.  These tests should be reinstated once
	   the WINC fileserver is more honest about the list of drives it
	   provides.
	10)Removed WINC test (Test2) from T_LOCATE which relies upon an
	   assumption that the session path will always be a root directory.
	   If the session path is a root directory, F32's FindFilePath() will not 
	   search the session path for a file if no pathlist is specified
	   as an argument to the function.  F32 changes may be required
	   here, and the test should subsequently be reinstated.
	11)Changed WINC versions of T_OOM, T_GEN, T_CHKUID and T_LOCK so that
	   they create their test directories on the current drive rather than C:.
	12)Changed T_GEN so that is uses \F32-TST as it's test directory
	   (like other F32 tests do) rather than using it's own \E32-MATH.
	13)Released \F32test\Group\WININFO.txt, containing information
	   about which directories and files need to be present for each
	   WINS/WINC test to succeed.

2)  Morgan
    1) Added tests to T_LOCATE
	2) Added some SUBST tests to T_FSRV

3)	Matthew
	1)	Added test to T_DLOCL to check that locale changes cause notification.

4)	Jo
	1)	Added new test T_SESS to test that multiple fileserver sessions can 
		be run concurrently, and that when fileserver sessions are closed, those 																remaining are unaffected.  Tests the fix for the F32 bug reported 												variously as SW1-363, 376, 413, 414, 417, 453 etc.  
		Needs F32 release>=112
	
	2)	Added new test T_REMOTE to test multiple fileserver sessions, including
		a remote filesystem (dummy implementation T_REMFSY.fsy).  
		Stress tests the fileserver by connecting multiple drives (each with
		20 fileserver sessions).  Additionally tests bug fixes SW1-587, 620
		
	3)	Minor changes to T_COMPAT for UNICODE build testing

	4)	Added a test for year 2000 compliance (\SERVER\T_FSY2K)

Version 0.01.03
================
(Made by Jonathan, 8th May 1998)

(1) Jo

	F32 failed the following tests:

	(1) T_COMPAT (Fails WINS UNICODE tests)

	Fails test1() [line111]
	RFile::Create() creates a unicode filename but when the test checks the 
	name using TFatDirEntry::Name() the name returned is not the ascii equivalent 
	of the unicode filename.  To be fixed.

	(2) T_FMAN (Fails WINS UNICODE tests)

	Fails testLongNames() [line 1055]
	Problem with scanning the directory list for long filenames in UNICODE.  
	To be fixed.

	(3) B_GEN (Fails WINS UNICODE tests)

	testVolumeName() [line550] fails.  
	This is because SetVolumeName() takes a unicode name but converts it to an 
	ascii name, doubling the length as it does so 
	(see SFAT\SL_MNT line 322 CFatMountCB::SetVolumeL() for the conversion 
	function).  To be fixed.

	(4) B_FAT (Fails WINS UNICODE tests)
	
	Fails testDirEntry() [line 558]
	The test creates a corrupt file then tests that KErrCorrupt is returned 
	upon attempting to read/write to the file.  In ascii this test detects 
	correctly that the file is corrupt but in unicode it does not detect a 
	problem.  The problem appears to be due to RFile::Create() noted in (1).

	(5) T_NOTIFY (Fails WINC tests)

	Fails test6() [line 260]
	Tests a media change notification which in WINC is not valid.  
	At present the test fails ungracefully with a Plat fault 46.  
	This will be changed when PccdCntrlInterface is replaced.


	Fixes to f32 tests for WINC defects:

	(1) Different values are (necessarily) returned in WINC and WINS on 
	trying to access a non existent device.  The code in several F32 tests 
	has been altered to check for either return value.

	(2) Excluded WINC from attempting to mount FAT filesystem on X or Y in 
	tests where it was previously attempting to do so in T_MAIN.

	(3) Added extra path information for WINC to successfully locate Z 
	drive in T_MAIN and a number of other tests.

	(4) Changes to T_FSRV to accommodate diffferences in file and 
	volume attributes between WINS and WINC. 


	Other fixes and improvements:

	(5) Added a trap handler to T_ROMG to get the test working.

	(6) Disabled autoswitchoff behaviour in B_RAND, T_FSYSBM and T_VFAT.

	(7) Added additional test to T_FIND.

	(8) Fixed of several UNICODE bugs in B_GEN.

	(9) Alteration to T_TLIBRY to test against correct values in several tests.


(2) Petteri

	(1) Minor changes to t_gen.cpp, t_gen32.cpp, t_parse.cpp and t_vfat.cpp so
	that they compile without warnings.

	(2) t_term.cpp: F1 changed to = in the help text.

	(3) Minor canges to t_proc.cpp and t_tlibry.cpp so that the tests don't fail
	in ARM ascii build.


Version 0.01.02
================
(Made by Jonathan, 10th January 1998)

1)	Jonathan
	1)	T_WARM - does nothing on WINS.
	2)	B_OPEN - No longer tries to test disk full on WINS emaulated drive C:
		used to fill the C drive with a huge file but this can fail because
		F32 can only handle files <= 1/2G.
	3)	T_VFAT - Fixed typo leading to files not being deleted. Prevented
		generation of three-letter filenames to avoid WIN32 special files like
		'AUX' and 'PRN'. Fixed confusion when replacing an existing file.
		Still fails on WINS X drive.
	4)	T_FIND - Tweaked the string used to match the kernel's process name.


Version 0.01.01
================
(Made by Alastair, 26th January 1998)

F32TEST contains those test programs which used to be a part of F32

1)  Some test renaming:
     benchmrk -> t_fsysbm, t_bench -> t_fsrvbm, t_comsoak1 -> t_commsk,
     t_bench -> t_fbsrvbm and more

2)  Minor bug fixes for t_vfat, t_fbsrvbm.

3)  Known problems - t_fsrvbm doesn't compile for WINS, and t_locdrv is out of date
    and won't compile for any platform
    t_libry and t_dlocl fail but that's because the foreign localisation dlls
	are't there anymore
