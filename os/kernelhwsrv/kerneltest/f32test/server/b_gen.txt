Differences from S3a B_GEN
==========================

testnodeinfo: Commented out - dunno what a node info is.
testdeviceinfo: TVolumeInfo structure doesn't contain a version member, test commented out
testfileinfo: TEntry structure doesn't contain a version number, test commented out

testrename: 
Long filenames are allowed
Test rename of directories across directories: This works - used to return AccessErr

testDelete: Attempting to delete a directory returns KErrBadName instead of an AccessErr
testUnique: Seeking ie. random access on a temp file is now valid - used to return E_FILE_INV

testVolumeName:
SetVolumeLabel will set the volume label to any string of 11 chars or less.

testDir:
All directories require some matching criteria eg: "*" or "*.txt"
Test filenames starting with '.' eg: \\.ZZZ are now legal.

test.Printf(_L("Test filenames starting with 05/E5\n"));
0xE5 at the start of a filename => a VFAT entry
0x05 at the start of a filename returns an error under NT

testMedia: Not implemented
testNodeInfo: Not implemented

testFileInfo: Changed argument values.
Paths are allowed on Z:
Asking for info on a drive that does not exist return KErrBadName not NoFileSystemErr

test.Printf(_L("Test weird filenames\n"));
All weird names are now valid except _L(" ");
All short names are valid except "" and "\\"
All long names < 256 chars are valid
Dots within a filename are valid

Test Make directory:
Long directory names are now valid < 256 chars

Test read of zero bytes:
No longer returns any EofErr. Instead reading zero bytes will zero the length of the buffer.

Test set file date:
Old test data commented out because NT fails on dates < 1601.

Interface to Format has changed (will probably be changed back shortly) Test commented out

Differences between WINS and EPOC platforms
===========================================
NT will register time differences of less than 30 microseconds FAT needs ~ 1/10 sec
The filename _L("...") -> KErrAccessDenied on NT but is ok on VFAT
0x05 at the start of a filename is disallowed by NT. VFAT will accept 0x05 but doesn't translate it into a 0xE5.
NT will match a single '?' to the _L(".") directory. VFAT never sees '.'
