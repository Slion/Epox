# Description:
CaseEquivalence.pl takes as its input the file UnicodeData-3.0.0.txt on the standard input stream and produces as output one of the following on the standard output stream depending on the option -o{t|f|r|m}:

-ot: produce a trie in C++ compilable format which gives a mapping for each Unicode character.
-of: produce a mapping of characters to canonical case equivalent character
-or: produce a list of canonical case characters and a list of what maps to each
-om: as -or but does not print those mappings for which only one character needs to map.

This is used to produce the e32 file FoldTable.inl

The files SpecialCasing.txt and CaseFolding.txt are not used by the tool as yet. These are other files from the Unicode Consortium.
