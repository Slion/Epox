* Description: 
* TEST KDDI/AU version.
* This is a test build of the "KDDI/AU" version of the J5 character conversion plugin,
* which uses a test UID (0x10000002) in place of the usual J5 UID. 
* The kddi/au version differs from the Docomo version by using shiftjis_kddiau_shared.dll
* rather than shiftjis_docomo_shared.dll, so the only difference is the kddi/au specific shiftjis
* conversions.
* This can then be tested by tj5_kddiau which loads
* this plug-in rather than J5_docomo by refering to the test UID
* Character conversion method that can convert from any of the following:
* character sets: Windows-31J (Microsoft code page 932), JIS (ISO-2022-JP-1), 
* EUC, UTF8, and UCS2.
* kddiau test version of j5.cpl converter
