Release 145 made by Graham Asher on 7th October 1999
====================================================

This release is intended for Text 6.0.

Fixed the following defects reported in Symbian Defect Tracking:

EDNGASR-4BWKHA: ETEXT test code ought not to depend on the text window server
EDNGASR-4CFD6Q: Import and export of Unicode plain text doesn't conform to the Unicode standard

Release 144 made by Graham Asher on 27th September 1999
=======================================================

This release is intended for Text 6.0.

Removed ancient history from this file (release.txt). You can still look at it by getting older versions.

Fixed the following defects reported in Symbian Defect Tracking:

EDNGASR-4C2EHD: ETEXT should build for WINC platform
EDNGASR-4C2EE5: CParaFormat::CopyL uses the heap unnecessarily.
EDNGASR-4C2ECH: TBullet's character code ought to be initialised to a bullet

While fixing the problem with CParaFormat::CopyL I was able to tidy up the construction and freeing of heap-based attributes: tabs, bullets and borders. I also removed or corrected many redundant and misleading comments.


Release 105 made by Graham Asher on 3rd March 1999
==================================================

This version is intended for ER5u.

Removed Standard Unicode Compression Scheme code. This is now in STORE 061. Changed txtetext.cpp to use the STORE version. Made ETEXT dependent on STORE 061.

Release 104 made by Lane Roberts on 28th January 1999
=====================================================

- Changed copyright messages to refer to Symbian.
- Upgraded MNT VALID to use EVALID.
- Binaries (.dll, .lib & .map) validate against 103.

EDN952697: Invalid assertion in CPlainText::Extract()

Release 102 made by Graham Asher on 19th January 1999
=====================================================

=====================================================

Fixed the following bugs (see 'ER5 defects'):

EDN642121: Panic when deleting an unused, user-defined style
EDN700414: CBase 21 panic, Word (ETEXT internalising a corrupt file)
EDN815855: Corrupt file
EDN211326: CStyleList::Remove fails to nullify iStyleForNextPara and iBasedOn pointers
EDN458446: Category() is not used and should be removed
EDN533608: Export as text doesn't output a BOM marker

Release 100 made by Graham Asher on 30th November 1998
======================================================

Two important bug fixes (see the 'ER5 defects' database on Notes)

ETEXT appears to store text on the clipboard differently to older roms
Word panic USER-CBase 21 importing text files

Release 099 made by David Batchelor on 12th November 1998
=========================================================

* Backwards compatible with 098
* WINS built with VC5
* Now dependent on BRDCST and FEPBASE

- Support for front-end-processor inline editing added in CEditableText. This
  consists of 6 new exported functions in that class:
	~CEditableText // calls CancelFepInlineEdit
	StartFepInlineEditL // cannot be called more than once without an intervening CommitFepInlineEditL or CancelFepInlineEdit
	UpdateFepInlineTextL // can only be called once StartFepInlineEditL has been called
	CommitFepInlineEditL // can only be called once StartFepInlineEditL has been called
	CancelFepInlineEdit // can be called regardless of whether StartFepInlineEditL has been called
	OverrideFormatOfInlineTextIfApplicable // (protected) to be called by MLayDoc-deriving classes at the end of their GetChars implementations
  Unfortunately, ETEXT clients won't call the new destructor without
  rebuilding :-(. Not much can be done about that. It shouldn't be very
  problematic if it's not called though. (In fact it should never need to
  be called if front-end processors do what their supposed to.)

- In order to add new member data to CEditableText in a binary-compatible
  way, I had to do a bit of awkward coding using thread-local storage. This
  is in TXTFEP.H and TXTFEP.CPP.

- Added a number of bug-fixes as advised by Graham Asher and Andrew Thoelke
  (defect-numbers are from the "EPOC Software Defects" database): SW1-267,
  SW1-316, SW1-323 and SW1-347.

- Added a cast at line 296 of TXTPLAIN.CPP to prevent a compiler warning.

- Fixed a bug where "mnt gete32" and "mnt getf32" were both getting WINC
  releasables without the necessary directories having been created in the
  epoc32 directory tree. This was causing all the WINC stuff to overwrite the
  contents of \epoc32\release\wins\udeb :-(.

- Rearranged "mnt getbld" to a more standard order, and passed the version
  number on to "getsrc". Thus doing a "pgetbld" on versions before the tip
  revision should now work.

- Commented out the initial "ebld cleantest" call inside "ebld testall".

- "ebld makeworkdir" now creates \epoc32\include before calling makmake's
  "makework" to prevent makmake errors.

- No changes were made to the test-code other than getting it to build
  without errors/warnings (well, very nearly without warnings). In order to
  get over the problem of the name clashes of EGray4 etc, it is necessary to
  hack the values of TVideoMode in \epoc32\include\e32twin.h to something
  else (e.g. add an initial '_'). (Test-code for the front-end-processor
  inline editing stuff is planned to be added at a later date.) All the
  WINS DEB and WINS REL test-code completes. However, a fair bit of
  WINS UDEB fails, and I haven't got time to look into this for this release.
  No MARM test-code was run (again, to speed up the release).


Release 097 made by Graham Asher on 7th September 1998
======================================================

The main change, and the reason for this release, is to compress externalized text in the Unicode
build to allay the fears of licensees about the size of stored text. The compression method is
the Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode, described in the Unicode Consortium's web site
at http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr6.html. It is relatively easy to implement, fast,
and compresses even very short pieces of text significantly. Text mainly in small alphabetic scripts
(Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, Devanagari, Thai, etc.) is compressed to about half its
original size, while pure Chinese text, which is probably the most difficult case, is expanded by
the single byte required to switch to plain uncompressed Unicode.

I have made some other small changes, mainly to allow the ARM version to buld cleanly.

Major changes in detail:

Added UNICOMP.CPP and UNICODE.H to the ETEXT source files; these implement Unicode
compression. All their code is #ifdef'd out in the narrow build.

Added TXTPLAIN.CPP and TXTPLAIN.H to the ETEXT source files; they replace TXTTRAN.CPP and TXTTRAN.H,
which is no longer exported (it was exported erroneously).

TXTETEXT.CPP: changed CPlainText::InternalizePlainTextL(RReadStream& aStream),
CPlainText::InternalizePlainTextL(RReadStream& aStream,TInt aLength),
and CPlainText::PasteFromStreamL(RReadStream& aStream,TInt aPos) to expand Unicode text according
to the compression scheme;
changed CPlainText::ExternalizePlainTextL(RWriteStream& aStream) const,
CPlainText::ExternalizePlainTextNoLengthCountL(RWriteStream& aStream) const,
and CPlainText::CopyToStreamL(RWriteStream& aStream,TInt aPos,TInt aLength) const
to compress Unicode text according to the compression scheme.

Added new exported functions, CPlainText::ImportTextL and CPlainText::ExportTextL, to import and export text in
CR-LF-delimited form. The existing functions work only with files; the new functions work with arbitrary streams.

TXTETEXT.H: added declarations for CPlainText::ImportTextL and CPlainText::ExportTextL.

Added a missing DEF file entry to the WINS debug builds: CRichTextStoreMap<CParagraphStyle>::__DbgTestInvariant.
