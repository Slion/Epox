052

General
) Fixed the mnt to install the template document upon a :getrel

Bug Fixes
) Got a work-round for Martin Armstrongs fax print thingy


------------------------


051

User Interface
) Removed Spell repeated word functionality (some of it just commented out so that it can be finished and re-instigated in V2)

Bug Fixes
) SW-5008
	Style description not updated immediately a change is made.
) SW3-743
	Word app View preferences dialog is unnecessarily squashed (see resource file changes)
) SW3-417
	Word's "View prefs" has a bizarre and IMO pointless top line
) SW3-863
	"Revert to saved" dialogs say "All changes will be lost." Full stop?

	removed the top-line choicelist for All/Some/None
	removed the dense packing flag.

-------------------------



050

Dependancies: c[0] + apparc[065] + Eikon[192] + wpeng[043]


General
) Release new template files.

) From Simon: Word no longer handles insertion of line breaks, hard hyphens and non-breaking spaces. This is now done in Eikon code.

) Word no longer supports insertion of soft hyphens at all. Ever. Option removed from Preferences dialog.

) RunPageSetupDialogL(): If page setup dialog is exited with enter it is assumed changes have been made and pagination is accordingly set out of date.

Bug fixes
) SW-4758
	Changing the header or footer doesn't mark the document as changed.  (or 'other' data).
) SW3-272
	Default left/right page margins
) SW-3328
	Cannot insert hard hyphen.  Eikon is now responsible for implementing this functionality.
) SW3-482
	"Delete style" dialogue box has duff title.
) SW3-528
	Removed soft hyphen from non-printing character visibility in Preferences dialog as it's no longer supported
) SW-5345
	Text menu pane took ages to appear if a large amount of text was selected
) SW-5383
	Exception launching iconic word with OOM
) SW-5231
	Buttons are the wrong way round in the "spell: repeated word" dialog
) SW-5386
	Unrecognized word in not put between the ellipses when spell checking a one word document
) SW3-364 
	Word's spellchecking "repeated word" dialog should have a stop button. The hotkeys in this dialog have changed - stop is now esc and skip becomes ctyrl-s (space could not be used because the dialog contains an edwin).



049

Delete...
r_word_importing_file
r_word_exporting_file

046
-----------------------------

045

General
) Broken the file format.
	App configutaion data is now written with a leading version number
This is a necessary change for future versions.
) Completely updates the WORD.DSC file for localization.
Doing so revealed unused resources that were still being included.  Now removed, see below.

User interface
) Added appropriate busy messages to file loading/saving/importing/exporting - see resource changes below.

CWordDocument
) Added version number to the head data streams that Word is responsible for. nb. App configuration data

Bug fixes
SW-4574
	When run embedded, Word does remember configuration data.
This has been fixed by making the Word document object responsible for saving/loading app configuration data.  This is made available to the CWordAppUi whenever it needs it.  ie, The configuration data (used by the AppUi) has a lifetime that extends beyond the lifetime of the AppUi itself.
SW-not reported
	Fixed some lurking OOM death with pop-out listboxes from the toolband
SW-3895
	Style Gallery shows "Times New Roman" sample text *monospaced*
SW-2901
	Text changes size if you change the font.
Fixed by not explicitly altering the font height. Hmmm.
SW-4274
	Toolband buttons animate/latch down when file is read-only
SW-4178
	Toolbar buttons not "dimmed" properly
SW-3658
	Word repaginates when there is no change in the print setup
SW-4512
	Are the default "Space above & below" settings OK for all styles?
SW-4310
	Change to WinPrint for new sample document 'Welcome 3'
SW-4538
	Welcome to Protea should start at the beginning.

Resource file
	Modified WORD.DSC in line with these changes.

Dialogs
r_word_dialog_file_open
	Removed completely since it is no longer used.

General text
r_word_saving_file
	Added for busy message when saving document
r_word_importing_file
	Added for busy message when importing text file
r_word_exporting_file
	Added for busy message when exporting text file

------------------------------------


044

General
) Taken the new word.aif as directed.

User Interface
) Moved the "Spell" button to the top of the toolbar, in an attempt to provide consistency across apps.  Requested by the Spec. Team.
) Removed the "deleting object requires confirmation" preference from the object preferences dialog.  This is no longer a custom option;  rather confirmation is always asked for - a policy implemented by Eikon code.  Resource file change - below.
) Due to changes in Eikon code, the screen is now only drawn once when loading a word document.  It no longer "bounces" into position as it did before
) Added a delayed busy message for loading and saving of documents.  The delay is currently 0.5 seconds.

Bug fixes
) SW-3665
	"Undo delete" menu option never ever dimmed
) SW-3948
	Inconsistent behaviour cancelling a password in sheet and word.
) SW-3402
	Word doesn't recognise formatting or spell checking as "changes" to file
) SW-3069
	 Buttons show "Bold" incorrectly

CWordDocument
) Provided new behaviour for the new apparc function ValidPasswordL();

Resource file

) Changed the name of the .def files for a WINS build.
) Changed the mnt :getapparc verb to get the relevant releasables
) Changed the .oby file as required by APPARC changes.

Template/Standard document
) Released 2 language variants of the standard document "Normal".
These are called...
	normal.us	// The US variant
	normal.uk	// The UK variant

The idea here is akin to that of resource files. ie, rename the one you want to plain old "NORMAL" without the extension.

Resource file
) Added defines for US resources as provided by the Localization team.

Bug Fixes
) SW-3219
	Converted file crashes on touching style button
) SW-3420
	Selected a graph in Word; did Spell; it said "0 unrecognised words"

	Spell correct option should have a busy message or other feedback...
) SW-2478
	Cannot select 1st suggestion from spell checker

	Removed the Text colour menu option from the Text menu.  It is reachable from the Font dialog.  Similarly removed this item from the Style format menu.
) Fixed SW-2442
	The Home and End keys now work.  The style hotkey mechanism was filtering out this mechanism.
) Fixed SW-2273
	Misspelling of "Centred" paragraph alignment.  See resource changes.

CWordDocument

Removed entirely
) Text | Colour
from the menu.  It has a presence in the font dialog, so...
The hotkey shift + ctrl + W (EWordCmdTextColor) becomes free.
As a result, removed EWordCmdTextColor from the .hrh file.

Menus
r_word_text_menu - removed "Colour" menu option
r_word_style_format_menu - as above
r_word_para_alignment_menu
	Corrected the spelling of "Centred" for the command EWordCmdAlignCenter

------------------------------------------------------

039

General
) Started rearranging resource file for easier translation, as per style guide.
) Put the new release file INCG.nnn containing the .RSS dependancies, as required for the translators build kit

Bug fixes
) when editing a read-only document, the password menu option was dimmed, but the hotkey was still active.
SW-1822
	Narrow style popout from toolband
SW-1853
	Cannot delete user defined style in the style gallery
SW-1810
	Passwords not being stored in the document
SW-1937

	difference in line spacing when including pictures
SW-1212
	read-only file attribute being inherited
SW-1409
	corrupt file problem - see below
) Several other bug reports are no longer tenable or have been marked as low priority.


Interface
) Moved the toolband bullets button to the very end of the toolbar.  This gives a little more congruence with the Sheet toolband.

CWordDocument
) Redesigned the mechanism by which new files are created from within the Word processor.  This fixes corrupt file problems (SW-1409) which occured if an application crash occured before the new file had been saved by the user.
Under the new scheme, a new file is valid *immediatley* upon creation.
To create a new file, the appropriate template document is located and copied to the desired destination.  This (new) file is then restored.
As a result have removed Word's implementation of CreateFileStoreLC() - called CreateFileStoreMinimalLC() which, in part, contributed to the above bug.
) As a result of the above, have simplifed the revert to saved mechanism, by removing a boolean from this class that tracked whether the persistent document was in a valid state to be reverted to.!!;-)  This has removed member data and methods from this class, as well as simplifying the code that actions the Revert to save command.

Resource file changes

General
) I have not ordered my resource file according to the style guide yet.  (This has already been changed since I first read this entry).
The Word resource file has logical structure to it, and I am unconvinced at present that it's worthwhile spending at least 2 hours performing a trivial reorganisation.
) Removed the thesaurus hotkey, as not present in v1.

r_word_document_unsaved - no longer a requirement for this.

038

037
) moved up to lexicon 019

) mnt run added that starts wsexe

) Taken new .ICN file from Shell.




---------------------------------
-36
User interface
) Renamed various menu resources at the request of documentation.

Bug fixes
) Fixed bug SW-845, by updating the printer device when changed.
) Fixed bug SW-695, read only files.
An info message is used to warn the user when a read only file has been opened.
Any other file actions performed whilst this file is being edited are now handled (elegantly), by use of a confirmation dialog.
) SW-704: No warning about bad filenames in "Create New File..."
) SW-285: Preferences dialog is too tall
) Opening a file on read-only media no longer stops you from opening or creating other files (it used to fail because Word tried to seed the dialogs with a read-only path).


-------------------------------------

035

General
) NOTE:
Following a change to the word engine, there is an unavoidable change to the way in which passwords now work, in the context of a main document containing embedded objects.

THERE IS A MAJOR IMPLICATION HERE THAT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED AND DOCUMENTED.

When you apply a password to a main/container document that holds embedded objects, that password WILL NOT be inherited by the contained objects.  Only the main document text will be encrypted.
(Passwords are now fully functional in Word, including embedded word documents)

) NOTE:
The number keys (1/2/3...) can now be used as paragraph style shortcuts, following the new release of the base.
) Updates the sample files, making Journal a little more visually stimulating, and a longer version of "Caesar".

User Interface
) Added a confirmation dialof for File/Revert to saved
) Added a confirmation dialog for the deletion of an embedded object.
This dialog will only be presented if you delete the picture as a single character, ie with no text selection.

Deleting a text highlight that covers one or more pictures will NOT generate this dialog.

A picture that is deleted as a single character is now undo-able.

Added a user-preference setting to the preferences dialog on the picture page.  The option is "Confirm on delete object", ebabling this dialog to be turned off if you find it frustrating.

) Added info messages if banned file menu options are selected by hot-key when Word is running as an embedded object.
) Fixed picture deletion bug SW-542
) Fixed picture deletion bug SW-806
) Checked protea spec. *text under ok & cancel buttons*
) Checked protea spec. *embedded app ui*
) Added missing ellipsis character to the print preview menu option
) Added Print setup to the File/Print cascade.


CWordDocument
) Implemented a new version of DoFileNewL(); that is more efficient.  This is because CWordDocument provides its own version of the virtual CApaDocument method...
	CFileStore* CreateFileStoreLC();  called....
	CFileStore* CreateFileStoreMinimalLC();

...creates a new file with the specified name, but does not save *any* document content to it - which the CEikDocument implementation does.
Only the app. identifier is written to the new file, [making it a valid file].  Word can get away with this since all document content is loaded from a standard document.

This is called for a File | New - since relying on the Eikon method means that your current document content is dumped into any new file that you create.

CWordAppUi
) The appUi now conforms to the new apparc model of life, whereby, at the end of editing an embedded word document, it returns if the embedded document is empty.  This information may be used by the container, to say, not insert (or remove) an embedded document if it is empty.  (This approach is taken by the word processor).

-----

032



--------

031

General
) Taken new components as shown

User Interface
) Stopped using word specific bitmaps for bullets and paragraph alignment, since eikon provides these.  (Makes word.mbm a tad smaller;-)
) Changed the code that dynamically constructs the pargraph alignment pop-out bitmap list, such that it has no dependancy on the ordering of items in eikon.mbg
) Removed the word specific password dialogs, and now using the ones provided by eikon.
) Removed word's override of CreateFileStore(), since there is no longer a reasonable justification for its presence.
) Remove unecessary file menu options when Word is running as an embedded document.
) Got the insert of special characters working from the keyboard.

and later.....

CWordAppUi
) has now taken responsibility for creating/initialising the required printer device for the print setup owned by the model.


-------------------


030

General
) Taken the new components as indicated
) Fixed the mnt.cmd file so :getsrc :getbld :bldnnn all work and pass the virgin drive test.
) Fixed a bitmap filename that was more than 8.3, which caused PVCS to ignore it.
) Fixed an mnt bug, which was attempting to install template files assuming they still had a file extension.
) Word is now embeddable.  Note...
Only the minimum amount of work has been done so far in making this work, so no menu tile dimming has taken place just yet.
The only limit to how deep you can recurse currently is the amount of resources available on your machine ;-)
) Released, for the first time the .PDB file for a Word WINS Deb build.

User Interface
) Done away with the view menu option Screen View/Page view, replacing them by the single check item Wrap to screen.
) Removed the menu options for applying heading 1/2/3 and Normal from the Paragraph/Styles cascade.  This cascade has now disappeared completely.
) Made the borders bitmaps in the drop-down list a wee-bit bigger.
) Fixed toolband drawing bug Sw-56
) Any text loaded/copied into the current word document that is of foreign font, not supported by the current image device no longer panics when you activate the font heights pop-out.
) Added a new dialog.
CTRL-SHIFT-O will run a manual zoom dialog, so you can experiment with various zoom settings.
The dialog will operate at setting at and between 10% to 200%.
) Reset the in-built zoom settings which now whizz you round 
66%, 80%, 100%, 150%.
The smallest zoom is small enough to view an entire line width in printer layout, with Letter sized portrait paper.
) Amended all drop-down list boxed from the toolband, such that will expand in width to fit text that is wider than the [default] button width.  The listboxes will expand by a maximum of up to 2 x button width.
) Fixed internal bug SW-12, Word will now draw both toolbands in a single burst, rather than the haphazard fashion of previous releases.
) Embedding Word in word showed some layout bugs in connection with the positioning of pop-out lists.  This has been corrected.
) CTRL-SHFT 'A' now immediatley changes paragraph alignment to the next alignment.  It no longer generates the laborious dialog (which still can be found in the pargraph style suite).  The order of rotation of alignments is Left,Center,Right,Justified...
) Begun the implementation of the Ctrl+Fn+n mechanism to apply paragraph styles.  Note, that with the current eikon release, any Ctrl+n key that is a normal hotkey is stolen, regardless of whether Fn modifier was used or not.

Spell Checking
) Improved the workings of running the spell checker.
) Fixed HA-160
) Fixed HA-393
) Implemented a progress bar whilst scanning the document when spell checking
) A user-dictionary is now supported, which new spellings can be saved in.  For the moment the user dictionary is store in c:\userdic

CWordDocument
) Changed the implementation of NewDocumentL().  Since this method is no longer called twice when the app is passed a command line from the shell, have removed the code that dealt with doing a minimal initialization where the document was created without being passed a filename.
) Implemented a new version of DoFileNewL(); that is more efficient.  This is because CWordDocument provides its own version of the virtual CApaDocument method...
CFileStore* CreateFileStoreLC();
...which writes only the app identifier to the dictionary(root) stream, and NO document content (Store()).
) File/Revert to saved now works properly.  However, you cannot revert immediately after creating a new file, until that file is saved for the first time.  --due to (forthcoming) changes in ConstructAppFromCommandLine() whereby CreateFileStoreLC() is called before the virtual NewDocumentL().  ie, the word document file is created before the document generates any content.
) Replaced all (5) occurences of TParse by the stack-friendly TParsePtrC.

CFileStore* CreateFileStoreLC(RFs& aFs,const TDesC& aFileName);

This method creates a new direct file-store with the specified name, but does not save *any* document content to it - which the CEikDocument implementation does.
Only the app. identifier is written to the new file, [making it a valid file].  Word can get away with this since all document content is loaded from a standard document.

CWordAppUi
) Removed a couple of unecessary calls that updated that filename label.
) Added SetParagraphFillTextOnly(ETrue) call to the MTextPageRegionPrinter initialisation, such that paragraph background colour does not flood outside of any paragraph borders during print/preview.

) Passwords modified.
The new security API is being used (though are still waiting at present to actually write encrypted document content to file).
The CWordDocument now reads and writes any existing security data AND acts on it.  This means that even if a passworded file is run from the shell, the user will be required to enter the password. ;-)
Under this new scheme, the (unencrypted) password is never stored in the object, only the security object itself is maintained.
Fixes bug 

Also added to the stream dictionary...

KUidWordAppUi

...which is the stream in which all AppUi data is stored, ie...
cursor position
zoom state 
etc...

Bug Fixes
) Changing the page size from, say, A4 to Letter now has immediate effect.  Previously, if in printer layout, it was necessary to change to screen layout and then back again to see any change.
) Fixed bug SW-257, taking the opportunity to greatly simplify some of the code involved.

General
) Swapped to using more of the eikon bitmaps instead of Word specific ones, thus reducing the size of WORD.MBM


Bug Fixes
) Revert to saved will now behave if called on a file that has not yet been saved.
This has been achieved by implementing a WordAppUi flag called WordDocSaved, which is set whenever a CmdFileSave or CmdFileSaveAs is called (from the AppUi).  This data is written to a distinct stream in the stream dictionary, specified by KUidWordAppUi, so that other UI specific data may be stored with the document.
) Fixed the paragraph bullets dialog, so that the character first highilighted is the current/last used character, instead of being hardcoded.
) Split CWordDocument::NewDocumentL() into 2 distinct functions.  The first locates the template file by means of a TFindFile struct, which was being decalred on the stack.  This struct is currently 860 bytes - a lot of stack !!!!.  The template file type was then checked by means of another non-trivial type put on the stack, and then finally, the template document Restored() into memory.
The 2 new functions perform i) locate&verify the template ii) Restore the template.  The huge stack no longer is a problem since the large objects are cleared off it at the end of the first function call.


Template Files
) A new temlpate file has been provided, that holds more options.  See below.
) A user defined template (saved to c:\system\apps\word\normal) that contains pictures will now load successfully.
The cause of this bug (and possibly other similar bugs), was overwriting the stack.

User Interface
) Add 2 more choices to the borders drop-down list box, namely None and Thin Horizontial.
) Promoted the Revert to style menu option to the paragraph menu pane, taking the opportunity to rename the option to Remove formatting in the process.
) Changed the name of the counterpart to Screen View, from Printer View to Page View, at the behest of Jezar.
) The menu options for display of the toolbar/band have been renamed to Show toolbar/band

Documents
) User preferences are now stored as part of the document content, so you no longer need to set the preferences to display paragraph ends, or force Sketch to be an icon and not a glass door.

General
1) Speeded up loading by about 1/2 sec by creating an empty document when started without a filename.
This requires Apparc 032.
2) Removed some bitmaps now provided by Eikon.
3) A couple more mnt tweaks - more work still required
4) Removed multi-column text listbox and custom font as they are no longer needed
5) Moved all list creation & destruction code from WPAPPUT.CPP to WPLBOX.CPP

Eikon verison


General
) Fixed a bug in the mnt verb :getrel which put the engine component in the wrong place.
) Turned off the deferred loading of pictures, since this gave no advantage, and unltimately only causes problems.  So when a document is opened now, all pictures will be loaded into memory immediately.  (Unless their owning app dll's cannot be located, in which case these pictures are defer-loaded).
) Removed all traces of the visited document list ;-(

Template
) Renamed the template file from Normal.wrd to just Normal.

AppUi
) All file dialogs are seeded with c:\documents\ as the default directory.

User Interface
) Altered the positioning of the last 3 buttons in the toolband.
) Added an Insert Chart option to the insert menu, reflecting the functions of the toolbar.


Bug Fixes
) Fixed potential alloc heaven & rollback integrity bugs in the loading of a new file, and its components.

General
) Taken new components as shown above
) Split the project in two, releasing the engine seperately to the app.  This requirement, other than being a general development method, was prompted by the PsiWin team, requiring independant access to the Word engine.
\WORD\GROUP mnt verbs will operate on both components ie, WPENG and WORD.  Summary changes...

\word\src has vanished
\word\word contains all the application specific code and headers
\word\wpeng contains the engine code, released as a seperate DLL
\word\inc contains only those headers released by the engine (other headers moved to \word\word)

The release (zip) files have consequently changed name (& the .oby files required)

Engine release files
wngwin
wngwind
wngarm
wnginc

Application release files

Each component can be worked on seperately as there mnt.cmd files in \word\word and \word\wpeng.

) Introduced a new releasable - NORMAL.WRD - acting as a default template.  See below.
This is contained in the release file TEMPLATE.nnn.  An mnt getrel from Word will unzip the contents of TEMPLATE.nnn into each of...
\epoc32\release\wins\deb\z\system\apps\word\
\epoc32\release\wins\rel\z\system\apps\word\
\epoc32\release\marm\z\
) Updated the SOCKETS.IBY obey include file.
) Use a word-specific .FRZ file, to ensure the correct ordinal 1 & 2 methods, for MARM builds.

User Interface
) The user is now only ever presented with printer fonts from the current printer model, instead of screen fonts as before.
) Now supports beaming/receiving IrDa. (Currently housed under the TOOLS menu option).
) Pictures can now be edited via the keyboard, the exact keys that perform this is a policy implemented by EIKON.
) Changed the "New File" dialog, to not use the "use new file" checkbox.  It's original presence was an oversight.
) Changed the "File Save As" dialog to not use the "use new file" checkbox.  This is the default behaviour, and we are awaiting a final spec decision to see if this is really required.
) Implemented the visited document list, though this is currently ear-marked for omission.  Implemented by the new source file eikvdl.cpp and corresponding header.
) Gone for the latest UI design from Ken, though some small details have still to be included.  Changes, in summary, are...
	toolbar reorganized
	borders button added to toolband.
	borders popout list added to borders button
	new bold/italic/underline bitmaps
	new down-arrow bitmaps
	removed superfluous black lines from around the edwin, as suggested by Bill.
	introduced the new button "Insert Chart" onto the toolbar
	all text labels are now clipped to a max. no. of pixels, instead of a max. no. of characters.

CWordAppUI
) Now rely on the EikEdwin family for the picture inserting + re-editingmechanism.
) Rationalised some of the code that deals with resetting the edwin and printing components, following the change to a new/loaded document.
) Rationalised the UpdateFilenameLabel() code, which had been needlessly repeated throughout the code.
) Added inline method, returning the CWordDocument* handle.  Saves multiple explicit casts.
) Removed much of the printing code, which has relocated in EikEdwin.
) Removed our own SetDocChanged() method since Eikon now provides this.
) The toolband buttons are updated by idle object, which on each run updates only button.  The idle object stores the formatting information it needs to update the rest of the buttons.
Tests have shown that this idle object is still required.  Updating all toolband buttons on every event makes scrolling through the document very jumpy & jerky, even after the various button refinements etc...;-(
) Added functionality to remove specific paragraph formatting, so called "revert to style".  (The character format equivalent is not yet supplied by system components).
) Added "single-level undo of block delete" functionality.  The undo stuff is provided in the new module WPUNDO.H/.CPP

The Model
) We have moved over to a new scheme for setting the default paragraph styles.  These used to be hard-wired, in extensive code.
The new scheme introduces the notion of a simple template, provided in ROM.  The contents of this word document/template (usually none), along with paragraph style definitions, are loaded into the current document as a result of creating a new main word document.
This is achieved by replacing the function
virtual void CApaDocument::NewDocumentL()
for which Eikon provides a default (empty) implementation.  This has allowed us to achieve a net loss in number of lines of code ;-)

Printing/Preview
) CTextPageRegionPrinter now is told when changes have been made to the current page setup.
) Fixed bug in print preview, spotted by JamesD.

Bug Fixes
) Fixed bug HA-310, application paragraph alignment from the menu cascade.  This became broken in the transition from the alignment button popping out a menu cascade to it popping out a listbox.
) Fixed bug HA-299. The spell server is now only shut down if it has been successfully connected.
