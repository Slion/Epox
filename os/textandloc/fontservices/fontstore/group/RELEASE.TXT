Version 061
===========
Released by William Roberts, 7th August 1999

Sorted out an alignment problem which shows up with the new GCC compiler. The TCharacterMetrics class member data
is a TUint16 and six TInt8 values, these values occur as data in a table inside a compiled font, and are extracted
using code such as:

		metrics=*((matchSection->CharacterMetricsList())+(aCode-matchSection->iStart));

The old GCC used to use memcpy() to transfer the 8 bytes involved, but the new compiler attempts to use
LDMIA followed by STMIA. This causes an alignment exception if the data does not lie at a multiple of
4 bytes, even though the most restrictive alignment within the structure is for a multiple of 2 bytes.

The fix is to specify the "packed" attribute for the structure, which tells the compiler not to assume
any strong alignment for the structure (unless it knows a priori, for example with local variables on the stack).
This is done by putting __attribute__ ((__packed__)) before the closing semicolon of the class definition,
but naturally it's done via a #define which is set to nothing unless GCC is being used. The effect in the code
is to cause the new compiler to use memcpy() once again.

Fixed a couple of problems in openfont.cpp which showed up with the new compiler:

FNTSTORE\SRC\Openfont.cpp: In method `COpenFontGlyphTreeEntry::COpenFontGlyphTreeEntry(TInt, const class TOpenFontCharMetrics &)':
FNTSTORE\SRC\Openfont.cpp:30: `COpenFontGlyph::~COpenFontGlyph()' is private
FNTSTORE\SRC\Openfont.cpp:45: within this context

FNTSTORE\SRC\Openfont.cpp:27: warning: return-type of `SetBitmap' defaults to `int'

The fixes are to make COpenFontGlyph::~COpenFontGlyph() protected, and to specify the return type TBool
for SetBitmap.

Version 060
===========
Released by Chris Cooper, 27th May 1999

ER5U baseline

Version 059
===========
Released by Graham Asher, 30th March 1999

Breaks binary compatibility and sets a new binary standard for ER5u. The new design allows complex scripts to be supported when necessary, including ligation, kerning, diacritic placement, and access to characters via glyph indices, and there is also provision for future expansion; reserved virtual functions and data members have been added where appropriate.

Works only with version 087 or later of FBSERV, version 085 or later of BITGDI, and version 010 or later of FREETYPE.

Version 058
===========
Released by Graham Asher, 22nd January 1999

Fixes the following defect reported in ER5 defects:

EDN227054: The character encoding used in the narrow build is not converted to Unicode correctly for the Open Font System

Binary-compatible (forward and backward) with releases 053-056 inclusive.

Version 057
===========
Released by Graham Asher, 15th December 1998

Fixes the following defect reported in ER5 defects:

EDN364691: Allow larger font sizes.

Binary-compatible (forward and backward) with releases 053-056 inclusive.

Version 056
===========
Released by Graham Asher, 9th December 1998

Fixes the following defects reported in ER5 defects:

EDN998932: Bold and italic font selection doesn't work for TrueType fonts

EDN569925: Open Font System typefaces are not grouped into families

Binary-compatible (forward and backward) with releases 053-055 inclusive.

Version 055
===========
Released by Graham Asher, 9th December 1998

Fixes the following defect reported in ER5 defects:

EDN376593: COpenFont::GetNearestFontHelper always returns typeface index 0

Binary-compatible with 054 and 053.

Version 054
===========
Released by Graham Asher, 11th November 1998

Fixes the following defects:

SW1-322: Cache memory calculations are wrong
SW1-325: Error in the adjustment of almost-square aspect ratios to exactly square

Binary-compatible with 053.

Version 053
===========
Released by Graham Asher, 6th November 1998

Allows indefinitely large glyphs to be rendered. This is important for printing on high-resolution printers using resident fonts. This meant a change to the layout of TOpenFontGlyphData, which means that binary compatibility is broken for the Open Font System yet again (for the group consisting of FNTSTORE, FBSERV and FREETYPE).

Open Font System mutually compatible components: FNTSTORE 053, FBSERV 083, FREETYPE 006.

Version 052
===========
Released by Graham Asher, 28th October 1998

Uses new Unicode UIDs. Debug and release builds are compatible.

Default algorithmic slant used for Open Fonts changed from 3/16 to 5/16 (fixes SW1-281: ).

The new UIDs are:

KFntstoreDllUid16 = 0x10003B1A (Unicode version of 10000179)
KUidOpenFontRasterizerValue16 = 0x10003B1F (Unicode version of 0x100012A6)

Version 051
===========
Released by Graham Asher, 26th October 1998

Further binary-incompatible changes for the Open Font System. New versions of FBSERV and FREETYPE need to be released. This version is soon to be superseded anyway, in another incompatible change, because of Unicode UIDs and debug/release compatibility.

New features: the new TOpenFontSpec class allows algorithmic slant, width, and other effects to be specified, and these effects are used automatically to compensate for non-square pixels and supply pseudo-italics where italics aren't available.

Version 0.01.050
================
Released by Graham Asher, 5th October 1998

Fixes the following defects:

SW1-57: Changes to code page 1252 require changes to FNTSTORE (i.e., euro & z-caron added)
SW1-125: HasUnicodeCharacterL should be a member of COpenFontFile, not COpenFont
SW1-218: The Open Font System should allow a file to contain more than one typeface

The most important change is the last one, and it is binary-incompatible with respect
to rasterizers (but binary-compatible for everything else that depends on it); in other
words, rasterizer DLLs, like FREETYPE 002, that depend on FNTSTORE 049 or FNTSTORE 048, need
to be rereleased. No rasterizers are part of an EPOC platform release yet, so this
is acceptable.

Version 0.01.049
================
Released by Graham Asher, 18th May 1998

Fixes bugs introduced in 048, which was the first release to support the Open Font system.
These are:
SW1-36: CFontStore memory leaks: COpenFontSessionCache and COpenFontSessionCacheList
SW1-37: CFontStore::RemoveFile breaks FBSERV test code
SW1-40: Some font metric functions don't take account of algorithmic width and height

Version 0.01.048
================
Released by Graham Asher, 8th May 1998

Added support for the Open Font system. The main changes are those to fntstore.cpp,
which acquires functions to install Open Font rasterizers and use them to create
Open Fonts, and the introduction of openfont.h, which declares the base classes for
the Open Font system, and openfont.cpp, which contains the base class member functions.

Version 0.01.047
================

1) Rebuilt with E32 125 to achieve MARM DEB/REL compatibility, rendering MARM DEB binary incompatible with previous versions.
2) Switched to MAKMAKE for building.

================
(Release by JamesD, 09-1-98)

1)Built with E32 107, F32 074, STORE 043 and GDI 057

2) Uses .GDR files created by GDTRAN 020 or above. 

3) Re-built against GDI 057 which is incompatible with GDI 053 in 
Unicode builds

Version 0.01.045
================
(Release by JamesD, 22-9-97)

1)Built with E32 107, F32 074, STORE 043 and GDI 053. 

2) Uses .GDR files created by GDTRAN 020 or above. 

3) Only change involves re-writing search through code sections 
to find the metrics and bitmap for a particular font. This is now 
done using a binary chop to improve performance when a large 
number of code sections are present.

3) To avoid rounding errors in FNTSTORE, Twips to Pixels conversions 
   are rounded down and Pixels to Twips conversions are rounded up.  
   This will eliminate the feature found in the Font dialogue, whereby 
   a the twips height of a CBitmapFont was larger than the twips height
   passed into GetNearestFont().
